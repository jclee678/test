The dollar fell sharply against all major currencies except the Japanese yen yesterday amid reports President-elect Ronald Reagan was being urged to declare an economic emergency after taking office in January. Gold prices rebounded from their losses of the previous session.
 
 The dollar has soared as credit-tightening by the Federal Reserve has pushed American interest rates to records. But some money market rates fell yesterday after James Baker, the chief of staff in the incoming administration, was quoted as saying that Mr. Reagan was ''seriously considering'' declaring a ''national economic emergency.''
 
 According to a trader at one New York bank, the rate on six-month Eurodollar deposits, which are dollars held outside the United States, fell from 19 1/2 percent to 18 1/2 percent with the report.  The rates recovered slightly late in the day, the trader said.
 
 ''This is a market that's poised for a turn in interest rates,'' the trader said. ''The exchange market is basically at the mercy of dollar interest rates,'' another said. Yen Loses on OPEC Decision
 
 The yen, meanwhile, moved lower following a decision by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to raise oil prices about 10 percent. Japan is nearly totally dependent on imports for its oil.
 
 The Bank of England said in a report that surging North Sea oil revenues, inflows of funds from OPEC members and a ''firm'' domestic monetary policy would continue to bolster the pound's value on currency markets.
 
 But the bank said the pound's already high value had helped cut the volume of manufactured-goods exports by 4 percent between the end of 1979 and the third quarter of 1980, and added that British exporters were becoming increasingly less able to compete on world markets.
 
 West Germany's Bundesbank said in a report, meanwhile, that the slumping mark was not likely to rebound until the nation's trade deficit eased and domestic interest rates climbed. Gold Higher in Europe, New York
 
 On bullion markets, gold rose $22.75 an ounce, to $581, in London, and climbed $12, to $575.50, in Zurich. Gold for December delivery rose $7.40, to $574, on the Commodity Exchange in New York. Republic National Bank of New York quoted gold at $576, up $9, in later dealings.
 
 The dollar was quoted at 4 P.M. in New York at: 1.9760 marks, down from 2.0040 Tuesday; 4.5850 French francs, down from 4.64; 1.7990 Swiss francs, down from 1.8150; 208.70 yen, up from 208.50 and $1.2072 Canadian, down from $1.2078.
