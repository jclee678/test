Falling interest rates pushed the dollar sharply lower on currency markets yesterday, while gold prices rose as much as $18 an ounce in Europe but declined slightly in New York.
 
 Yesterday's foreign exchange trading marked ''a continuance of Friday: lower interest rates and a lower dollar,'' a currency trader for a major bank in New York said. The interest-rate cuts touched off speculation that borrowing costs might begin to decline after climbing steadily since early summer amid credit tightening by the Federal Reserve.
 
 The trader said the rate on three-month Eurodollars, dollars on deposit with banks overseas, dropped about a point yesterday, to 18 3/4 percent, leaving them 2 1/4 points below their peaks of early last week.
 
 One-month Eurodollars were off 2 1/4 points from last week's high, at 20 3/4 percent, he said, while six-month Eurodollars slipped 3 points, to 16 1/2 percent. First Cut Since July
 
 The Wells Fargo Bank, meanwhile, became the first major American bank to cut its prime lending rate since July, reducing its charge on loans to its best customers half a point, to 20 1/2 percent.
 
 ''The end product of all that is a weaker dollar,'' a dealer said.  The British pound moved higher despite a forecast by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development that Britain's recession would persist through 1981, leaving the country with a record 12 1/4 percent unemployment rate by the first half of 1982.
 
 In New York, the pound was quoted at 4 P.M. yesterday at $2.3542, up from $2.3508 Friday, while in London, the pound rose to $2.3530 from $2.3380. Late Dollar Rates
 
 Late New York dollar quotations yesterday included 1.9537 West German marks, down from 1.9650; 4.5305 French francs, down from 4.5663; 1.7745 Swiss francs, down from 1.7800; 207.55 Japanese yen, down from 207.70, and 1.1894 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1918.
 
 Dollar rates in Japan and Europe included 207.80 yen in Tokyo, down from 209.30; 4.5575 French francs in Paris, down from 4.5975; 1.9610 marks in Frankfurt, down from 1.9860; 1.7755 Swiss francs in Zurich, down from 1.8055; 936.50 Italian lire in Milan, down from 945.35, and 2.1335 Dutch guilders in Amsterdam, down from 2.1590.
 
 Dealers said bullion markets were growing quieter as Christmas neared. Gold for December delivery, which jumped $24.80 an ounce on the Commodity Exchange in New York Friday, was off $2.10 yesterday at $592.20. The Republic National Bank of New York quoted gold at $593.75, off 75 cents.
 
 Earlier, gold rose $13.50 in London, to $598.50, and climbed $18 in Zurich, to $593.50.
