Dollar Gains Broadly, But Falls Against Yen
 
 High interest rates in the United States bolstered the dollar against major European currencies in late New York trading yesterday, but the high cost of financing commodity purchases sent gold prices lower.
 
 The dollar did not fare as well in Japan, where it dropped to a six-week low against the yen. The dollar closed at 209.65 yen in Tokyo, down from Friday's 213 yen. Dealers attributed the yen's strength to a general feeling that it has been undervalu ed in recent weeks.
 
 Elsewhere, high interest rates in the United States, where the 19 percent prime lending rate at major banks is approaching the record 20 percent rate set last spring, continued to make investments in dollars attractive.
 
 Dollar rates in late New York trading included; 1.9615 West German marks, up from 1.9565 Friday; 4.5345 French francs, up from 4.5100; 1.7707 Swiss francs, up from 1.7670; 207.78 Japanese yen, down from 211.28, and 1.1956 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1953. Pound Is Off in New York
 
 The British pound was less expensive in New York, worth $2.3441, compared with $2.3450 Friday. In London, it c ost $2.3410 to buy one pound, compar ed with $2.3393 Friday.
 
 Dealers in Frankfurt said dollar interest rates continued to climb, lending more credibility to the United States currency's gains there.  ''Short of a Soviet invasion, developments concerning Poland will spark the market, but interest rates are making the gains stick,'' one dealer said.
 
 Dollar rates in Europe yesterday, compared with Friday's rates, included: Frankfurt, 1.9650 West German marks, up from 1.9592; Zurich, 1.77425 Swiss francs, up from 1.7675; Paris, 4.54125 French francs, up from 4.5355, and Amsterdam, 2.1265 guilders, up from 2.1235.
 
 In New York trading yesterday, gold prices fell $7.60 a troy ounce, to $613.20, in contracts for current delivery on the Commodity Exchange. Bullion was later bid at $614.50, down $5.50 a troy ounce, at Republic National Bank in New York.
 
 The precious metal was mixed in European markets, rising $2.75 in London, to close at $617 a troy ounce, and falling $1 in Zurich, to end the day at $615.50.
 
 A New York dealer said that, because of high interest rates, ''it is getting expensive to finance all commodities, gold included.'' He said preoccupation with interest rates was more than offsetting market concern over tensions in Poland and unrest in the Middle East.
 
 Silver prices slipped 10 cents an ounce from Friday to close at $17.70 a troy ounce in London. Silver ended the day at $17.41 a troy ounce, down 55 cents, in contracts for current delivery on New York's Comex.
