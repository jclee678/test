CAPITAL SPENDING SEEN RISING

United States businesses plan to increase spending on plant and equipment by 2.5 percent during the first half of 1981, after adjustment for inflation, a Government survey reported today.
 
 Courtenay Slater, the Commerce Department's chief economist, said the expected expansion was ''relatively strong and indicates the economy is more robust than we thought.''
 
 However, these plans reflect business sentiment in October and November, before the prime rate had reached the record-tying 20 percent set today. The prime stood at 13 1/2 percent on Oct. 1 and 14 1/2 percent on Nov. 1.
 
 Fears that the rising rates may drive the economy into another recession and cut deeply into consumer demand could inhibit capital spending, economists say. 'A Little Bit of Caution'
 
 Robert Gough, vice president of Data Resources Inc., a private forecasting firm, said the projected increase in capital spending ''must be viewed with a little bit of caution.''
 
 His own firm predicts a less robust performance than the 5.1 percent annual rate of increase indicated by the Commerce Department survey.
 
 Mr. Gough also suggested that Ronald Reagan's election raised business confidence higher than general economic conditions might justify.
 
 The Commerce Department's report showed that nonfarm businesses plan capital spending at a $317.5 billion annual rate during the first six months of 1981.
 
 The latest estimate of capital spending for all of 1980 is $294.3 billion, 8.8 percent above the 1979 total, the department said.  Spending in 1979 totaled $270.5 billion, 17 percent higher than in the previous year. These figures are not adjusted for inflation.
 
 ''Manufacturers are estimating 1980 capital spending at $114.9 billion, 16.5 percent more than in 1979,'' the report said.  ''Nondurable-goods producers report a 19 percent increase.''
 
 Over all, durable-goods manufacturers expect spending on plant and equipment to reach a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $65.36 billion in the second quarter next year, the survey indicated. That compares with a planned $57.42 billion annual rate in the current quarter. Auto producers plan to spend at an annual $9.9 billion rate in the second quarter next year, compared with an expected $9.2 billion pace in the current quarter.
