The cost of living in the New York metropolitan area rose by a seasonally adjusted 0.8 percent in November. Federal statisticians said it was clear that for the second year in a row the region's annual inflation rate would be more than 10 percent.
 
 ''This is unprecedented for this region in peacetime,'' said Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, regional commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, in announcing the latest Consumer Price Index figures. ''We've never had two years of back-to-back, double-digit inflation except for a couple of years during World War I and World War II.''
 
 He said inflation had been felt ''in every major area,'' including housing, food and transportation, and he added that ''probably one of the most important factors has been a lower rate of productivity.'' Higher Most Other Places
 
 Perhaps one consolation for New Yorkers is that inflation is worse almost everywhere else in the country.  The increase in the New York area in November brought the annual inflation rate so far to 10.6 percent, tying the region with the Greater Denver area for the lowest inflation rate among the 18 major metropolitan areas surveyed by the bureau.
 
 Worst hit by inflation, all with rates of 15 percent or more, were Chicago, Detroit and Seattle, Mr. Ehrenhalt said. The national average was 12.6 percent.
 
 The sharpest increases in the New York area were in the cost of food, housing and transportation, Mr. Ehrenhalt said, with food prices out in front of the others - 1.3 peracent higher than the previous month. Transportation Increases
 
 The cost of transportation in the New York area in November increased 0.9 percent, reflecting rises in the price of both new and used cars and in repairs and financing.
 
 For the year so far, the cost of public transport alone was up 19.2 percent. But that compared with an average rise of about 28 percent for the country as a whole.
 
 The average increase in housing costs in the New York area for the month was 0.6 percent, Mr. Ehrenhalt said, but rent alone went up 1.5 percent. Other factors that pushed up total housing expenses were rises in property taxes and interest rates for borrowing.
 
 The cost of medical care, entertainment and clothing was slightly lower in November than during the previous month.  Fruit and vegetables also cost less, but the general home food basket increased in price by 0.9 percent and eating in restaurants went up by 1.5 percent.
 
 ''Food has become a leading factor in the inflation picture,'' Mr.  Ehrenhalt said. ''In recent months, it has been mostly increases in meats. But this month most catagories went up.''
 
 He said gasoline prices had delined for the fifth month in a row.  ''The supermarket,'' he said, ''is replacing the gas pump as the symbol of our current inflation.''
