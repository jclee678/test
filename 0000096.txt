The price of gold took a beating yesterday, losing more than $30 an ounce in Europe and more than $20 in New York.  Dealers said soaring United States interest rates accounted for sharp gains by the dollar against most currencies and the losses by gold.
 
 Interest rate developments in the United States have ''all but taken control'' of bullion and currency markets, a trader said.  In New York, a dealer said gold's drop was ''100 percent because of interest rates.'' He said the market action yesterday ''was onesided, all down.''
 
 Rising American interest rates make the dollar more attractive since they mean higher yields for dollar-denominated investments. Moving Funds Out of Gold
 
 Gold has suffered, dealers say, because many investors have been moving funds out of gold and into dollars where they can get high yields on investments with less risk than in bullion markets. High interest rates also make it more expensive to acquire funds for gold purchases.
 
 In Zurich, gold slumped to $563.50 a troy ounce, down $32 from Wednesday and its lowest price since early June. In London, the precious metal dropped $19.50 to close at $560.00 a troy ounce. Gold had shed $26 an ounce Wednesday.
 
 In New York, gold closed at $544 a troy ounce, down $21 in current contracts traded on the Commodity Exchange. The late bid at Republic National Bank was also $544, down $23 from Wednesday's late bid.
 
 In currency markets, the dollar posted strong across-the-board gains. At one point in Frankfurt trading the currency jumped to its highest level against the mark since September 1978.
 
 West Germany's central bank intervened to keep the dollar down, dealers said, adding that the dollar catapulted to its two-year high of 2.0247 marks once it became clear the Bundesbank's key lending rates would not be raised as well. The dollar then fell back to close at 2.0095 marks in Frankfurt, up from 1.9938. It surged again in later New York trading, ending the day at 2.0205 marks, up from 2.0077.
 
 Other rates for the dollar as of 4 P.M. in New York included: 4.6775 French francs, up from 4.6400; 1.8295 Swiss francs, up from 1.8190; 210.77 Japanese yen up from 210.00; 1.2016 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1989. The Canadian currency was at its lowest point against the United States dollar since the 1930's. The British pound cost $2.3220, less than Wednesday's rate of $2.3405.
 
 In London, the pound fell almost 4 cents at one point during trading but recovered partly. The pound was worth $2.32 in late trading, compared with $2.3405 Wednesday.
 
 In Milan, the late rate of 958.50 Italian lire to the dollar set a record. The rate Wednesday was 946.05 lire.  Other rates for the dollar in markets abroa d were: Zurich - 1.83695Swiss francs, up from 1.80505; Paris - 4.7025 French francs, up from 4.62125; Amsterdam - 2.1995 guilders, up from 2.1665; Tokyo - 211 yenup from 209.25.
