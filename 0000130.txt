Higher interest rates helped push the dollar higher against most foreign currencies in major markets yesterday.  Gold prices dropped sharply in London and Zurich and by smaller amounts in New York.  Dollar rates bounced around throughout the session, reflecting a number of economic developments, but the overall trend acted to firm the dollar, a New York dealer said.
 
 The currency got a strong push in early trading from the Federal Reserve's decision late Thursday to raise its disc ount rate to 13 percent from 12 percent, and to impose additi onal surcharges on big borrowers.
 
 Then, major banks across the nation raised their prime business loan rates from 18 1/2 percent, to 19 percent, yesterday. Trading Crosscurrents
 
 Still, dealers said news of somewhat lower wholesale price inflation in November and a sudden drop in the Federal funds rate to about 16 percent in money markets during the afternoon created crosscurrents in trading.
 
 But the dollar headed back to near its highs for the day by late afternoon. Although most trading had ended for the day, rates moved higher following release of the weekly Federal Reserve report on money supply and bank loans that showed continued strong growth in both sectors. That development was seen as an indication that high interest rates will continue.
 
 High rates make the dollar attractive for investors.  Bullion dealers in Zurich said concerns about the political situation in Poland were offset by the interest rate news and helped pushed down gold prices. The more it costs to borrow money for gold purchases, the less people are interested, a dealer said. Gold Off in New York, Europe
