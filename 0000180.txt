ENEGRY STOCKS LIFT AVERAGES


19801127T000000Z


Surging gains for energy-related stocks sent several market averages to new highs yesterday, and the New York Stock Exchange's index of 1,540 common issues finished just below the record.
 
 It was a tumultuous session that saw the stock market struggling with its proverbial nemesis - rising interest rates - and emerging victorious on the eve of today's Thanksgiving holiday.
 
 Yesterday morning, major banks raised their prime lending rate to 17 3/4 percent from 17 percent. The stock market shrugged this off.  In the early afternoon, the Wells Fargo Bank raised its prime rate a full point, to 18 percent, and that move trimmed gains in the popular averages.
 
 Standard of California Up 11
 
 One standout was Standard Oil of California, which jumped 11 points, to 115 1/2. Wall Street analysts attributed this advance to a ''background'' report released by the Union Pacific Corporation. This report, providing increased estimates for oil and gas reserves in the Overthrust Belt of the Rocky Mountains, sent Union Pacific ahead 4 1/2 points, to 91 1/2. Union Pacific's Champlin Petroleum division is active in the Overthrust Belt.
 
 Standard of California, along with Standard Oil (Indiana), which rose 4 7/8, to 95 3/4, and was the most-active list's best gainer, also has important holdings in the Overthrust Belt.
 
 The Dow Jones industrial average, reflecting the performance of Standard of California, finished at 989.68 with a 7-point gain. Union Pacific Gain Lifts Index
 
 The advance in Union Pacific helped to propel the Dow Jones transportation average 7.22 points higher, to a record closing at 421.59.
 
 Price gains in energy issues produced a new high for the American Stock Exchange's index. It rose 4.15 points, to 365.75.  The Big Board's composite index gained 0.46, to 80.78. The record finish came last Thursday at 80.90.  Trading volume, at 55.3 million shares, slipped below Tuesday's turnover of 55.8 million.  Advancing and declining issues were about equally balanced. But, like the Amex, the Big Board's index is calculated by market value.  This means that price gains in large-capitalization issues, such as energy companies and railroads, can affect the indexes to a meaningful degree. Oil-Price Prospects a Factor
 
 Energy stocks have dominated Wall Street' s interest for the last two sessions. This strength stems partly from prospects of rising oilprices. Another ingredient is the general bel ief that the administration of President-elect Ronald Reag an will act to increase domestic energy supplies and, perhaps, even s peed up the decontrol ofoil and gas prices.
 
 Commenting on stock market prospects in an interview yesterday, Donald I. Trott, director of research at A. G. Becker & Company, stated: ''Basically, we envisage the continued favorable performance by three groups - energy, technology and energy-related capital goods. Many people are trying to be geniuses and avoid the obvious, but stocks in these three groups are subject to further accumulation by institutional buyers. Incidentally, you're going to see a very favorable Government posture toward the energy industry.''
 
 In terms of market barometers, Mr. Trott suggested that too many observers were concentrating unduly on the Dow Jones industrials. He predicted that the Dow would climb to between 1,050 and 1,075 ''within the next six months.'' The Dow's record closing stands at 1,051.70, reached on Jan. 11, 1973, in a rally that followed the reelection to a second Presidential term of Richard M. Nixon.
 
 Mr. Trott forecast that the Big Board's composite index ''will break 100 by mid-1982,'' a performance he would regard as ''much more significant than the Dow.'' Estimates of Experts Cited In its ''ba ckground'' report, Union Pacific stated: ''Industry experts curre ntly estimate that total Overthrust reserves in Wyoming,Utah and Idah o may range up to 15 billion barrels of oil and 63 trillion cubi c feet of natural gas.''
 
 Late yesterday, Union Pacific noted that ''all reserve projections on the Overthrust Belt are speculative at this time.'' It added that the data cited in its report were based on a paper delivered by Richard Powers, a Government geologist, last June 11.
 
 Missouri Pacific, the proposed merger partner with Union Pacific, climbed 6 5/8, to 110 1/2, in a generally buoyant railroad group.  The 20th Century-Fox Film Corporation, which said Tuesday it was considering plans to go private, rose 8 1/4, to 54 3/4.
