After a week of steady gains, the dollar eased against most major currencies on foreign-exchange markets yesterday. Gold prices climbed by $28 to $29 an ounce in New York after a mixed showing abroad.
 
 Interest rates remained the major market force, dealers said. Rapid rises in interest rates earlier in the week had pushed the dollar sharply higher against other currencies. High rates also helped push down the price of gold as investors pulled funds out of bullion and into interest-bearing investments.
 
 Declines in some short-term rates in money markets yesterday helped reverse both trends. The dollar declined against most currencies and the lower rates helped spur renewed buying of gold in the late New York market. In addition, some bullion dealers in New York said gold was considered underpriced after dropping to its lowest levels in about six months on Thursday.
 
 The price of gold jumped yesterday by $28.50, to $572.50 a troy ounce, in current delivery contracts traded on the Commodity Exchange Inc. in New York. The price was bid at $573, up $29, at the Republic National Bank. Silver Up by $1.73 on Comex
 
 Silver prices also jumped in New York. Silver rose $1.73 an ounce, to $15.23, on the Comex. In earlier London trading, silver's price rose just 5 cents, to $14.85 an ounce.
 
 London's gold price rose 50 cents, to $560.50 a troy ounce. In Zurich, Europe's other major bullion market, gold dropped $10, to $553.50 an ounce. The price in Zurich was $617.50 an ounce on the previous Friday.
 
 In currency markets, dealers in London said the dollar was strong in the morning against some currencies, but a combination of lower Eurodollar rates and afternoon profit taking pushed the dollar down.  That trend continued in later New York trading, although the dollar did post slight gains against the British pound and Canadian dollar by the end of trading.
 
 Rates for the dollar, as of 4 P.M. in New York, were: 2.0028 West German marks, down from 2.0205; 4.6400 French francs, down from 4.6775; 1.8175 Swiss francs, down from 1.8295; 210.45 Japanese yen, down from 210.77, and 1.2045 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2016. The British pound cost $2.3210, less than Thursday's $2.3220.
 
 Here is how the dollar fared in Europe yesterday compared with Thursday: Frankfurt, 2.0010 marks, down from 2.0095; Zurich, 1.8145 Swiss francs, down from 1.83695; Paris, 4.64625 French francs, down from 4.7025; Amsterdam, 2.17125 guilders, down from 2.1995, and Milan, 947.25 lire, down from 958.50.
