OHIO GOVERNER URGES NEW TAXES TO PREVENT 'ECONOMIC DISASTER


19801216T000000Z


Governor James A. Rhodes of Ohio today urged a series of immediate, temporary tax increases to ''preserve basic human services'' in the state and ''to prevent an economic disaster from which it might take years to recover.''
 
 He made his plea before a joint session of the Democrat-controlled Ohio General Assembly. The Governor, a Republican, asserted that the state's deficit was growing at the rate of $80 million a month.
 
 The request for new, although temporary, taxes, represented a departure from Mr. Rhodes' historic opposition to new taxes. He has been Governor since 1963 except for the four-year term of John J.  Gilligan from 1971 to 1975.
 
 Mr. Rhodes urged state legislators to enact a temporary 1 percent increase in the state sales tax, which is now 4 percent, a temporary sales tax on cigarettes and packaging, temporary increases in beer and wine taxes, a surtax on corporate franchise tax and a temporary increase in a tax on utilities. Republicans to Control Senate
 
 The Republicans won control of the Ohio Senate in the election and will have an 18-to-15 majority next year. The current Democratic majority has been reluctant to increase taxes during the ''lame duck'' session, fearing they would be remembered in the 1982 gubernatorial election as the party that raised taxes. The Democrats prefer to delay action so that the Republicans in the Senate and the Republican Governor will have to share the potential political liabilities of a tax increase.
 
 Mr. Rhodes attributed Ohio's severe fiscal crisis to ''chilling effects of high interest rates and inflation'' which, he said, have left tens of thousands of Ohioans without jobs. He said that 33,000 workers were added to the unemployed list last week and that many Ohio farmers and small businessmen are being forced into bankruptcy.
 
 Mr. Rhodes said that Washington economists had claimed three months ago that the recession was over but that ''things got worse, not better.'' He noted that the Ohio economy is tied closely to the automobile industry and is hit first and hardest in any major recession.
 
 The Governor noted that there were many unpredictable factors this year that contributed to the state's economic problems, including a 9 1/2 percent unemployment rate and $1.7 billion in unemployment benefits claims, an increase of $1 billion over last year.
 
 The Governor had ordered a 3 percent cut in state expenditures last June and another 3 percent in November, while the Ohio Legislature had ordered a 2 percent spending cut when it adopted its two-year budget in 1979.
 
 He said that the reductions of $204 million left a projected deficit of $496 million. Mr. Rhodes said that, in addition to requesting temporary taxes, he plans to order further reductions in state spending on Jan. 1 to save another $101 million.
