Another jump in the prime lending rate announced by major United States banks yesterday helped push the dollar higher against most major currencies in foreign exchange trading.
 
 Gold prices fell in major markets.  Dealers in Frankfurt said dollar movement was wide, with the currency starting lower and then rising, so that after the announcements on the prime rate, the dollar closed above the levels late Monday. The banks, led by Chase Manhattan Bank, increased the prime to 18 1/2 percent from 17 3/4 percent.
 
 Trading was described as fairly active in New York, where dealers also said the prime rate increase was the major factor pushing the dollar higher. Mild Reaction to Political Events
 
 Middle East tensions and the situation in Poland continued to be closel y watch ed by traders. But European dealers said that the market was un likely to show a major reaction unless events worsened drastically.  ''The market isn't as elastic as usual, and news has to be big to sha ke trading,'' one dealer commented.
 
 Bullion markets also showed little response to international tensions. Dealers said the price held fairly steady for much of the session in Europe, then dropped on news of the higher prime rate.
