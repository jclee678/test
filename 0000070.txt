OPEC approved higher oil prices, but the gap between Saudi Arabia and the other 12 members widened. The base price used by most OPEC nations can rise $4, to $36 a barrel, and other permitted allowances will push the OPEC ceiling beyond $40 for the first time. But Saudi Arabia's base will rise only $2 a barrel, to $32. (Page A1.) The price decision could increase gasoline prices in the United States by five cents to seven cents a gallon. (D15.)
 
 Reagan advisers now plan less drastic downgrading of the Trade Representative's office, taking the edge off the sharp criticism that had greeted the transition team's suggestion that the office be abolished. (D1.)
 
 The short term of an appointment to a top Commerzbank post may signal a broader personnel review. Profits have been poor at the German bank, a performance complicated by the illness of Robert Dhom, who is retiring as board member and spokesman. His replacement for one year will be Paul Lichtenberg. (D6.) The Economy
 
 The prime rate hit a record 21 percent, a painful level especially for the many companies that pay even more than the prime for borrowed money. Bankers expressed sympathy, and even said they might make cheaper loans available, but said the Fed's tight-money policies left them little choice but to raise their base rate. (A1.)
 
 Industrial output rose again in November, but a bit more slowly than in the previous two months. The 1.4 percent gain still left output 2.5 percent below November 1979, however, and there was some evidence that longer-term growth was slowing. (D1.)
 
 Housing starts fell last month, the first decline since May.  Single-family dwellings were particularly hurt by high mortgage rates, falling 4.8 percent after October's 2.1 percent dip. But multi-family starts rose. Overall, starts are running 28 percent below 1979, the Commerce Department said. (D1.) Markets
 
 Stock prices were firm despite the latest jump in the prime rate, apparently reflecting some confidence that interest rates were near a peak. The Dow Jones industrials gained 6.49 points, to 918.09, on a late rally. There was a feeling that the OPEC oil price rise would benefit energy companies, and their strength fueled the rally. (D8.)
 
 Neither the high prime nor a record yield attracted buyers to twoyear Treasury notes. Response to the record 15.15 percent yield was disappointing. (D11.)
 
 Gold prices fell. The dollar was mixed, caught between the contrasting pressures of higher interest rates and the rise in oil prices. Gold was quoted late in the day at $567 an ounce, down $8, after sharper losses in Europe. (D12.)
 
 A recovery in grains and metals prices stalled. Buyers stayed out of the market because higher interest rates have made carrying commodities inventories too costly. (D12.) Companies
 
 A plan that would give Renault effective control of American Motors was approved overwhelmingly by A.M.C. shareholders. Gerald C.  Meyers, A.M.C.'s chairman, said that bankruptcy was the only alternative to allowing the French Government-owned company to increase its equity and investment in A.M.C. (D1.)
 
 Xerox will restructure its marketing in the United States, setting up smaller sales regions and more branches, to meet growing competition. (D5.)
 
 Firestone Tire reported a loss, but Dresser posted a profit in the fiscal fourth quarter. The tiremaker's profits abroad were more than offset by domestic losses. (D6.)
 
 Debate begins today on changes in currency accounting. A Federal Accounting Standards Board draft suggests a current-cost approach to dealing with foreign exchange transactions, but supporters of the traditional historical-cost are numerous. (D1.)
 
 Control Data will donate $700,000 to a New York University unit that is directed by Nobel Prize winner Wassily Leontief. Control Data will get commercial rights to his economic research (D6.) Today's Columns
 
 Most parts of ''supply-side'' economics are not new; in fact, a case can be made that John F. Kennedy's 1964 tax cut was ''supplyside'' in all but name. Economic Scene. (D2.)
 
 Johnson Electronics and Digital Products, two obscure Florida companies, could be headed for strong growth because of their innovative products and aggressive marketing. But the competition is strong. Market Place. (D8.)
