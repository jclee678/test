2-Year U.S. Notes Sold at 13.99% By MICHAEL QUINT
 
 The Treasury continued its heavy borrowing to finance the nation's budget deficit yesterday by selling $4.5 billion of two-year notes at an average yield of 13.99 percent, up sharply from 12.24 percent paid on two-year notes sold a month ago.
 
 Today, the Treasury will auction $4.5 billion of new one-year bills, which closed on the secondary market yesterday at about 13 1/8 percent, for a bond equivalent yield of about 14 5/8 percent.
 
 At the Bank of New York, economists explained that the large size of Treasury borrowings ''has played an undeniable role in pushing rates higher so far in the second half of the year.''
 
 The 13.99 percent yield on the two-year notes was the secondhighest ever paid at a two-year note auction, exceeded only by the 15.01 percent paid last March. At that ti me, the Federal Reserve had pushed short-term interest rates to their all-time peaks in an effort to slow growth of the money supply.
 
 Currently, the Fed is again using higher interest rates to slow growth of the money supply, though rates have not climbed to the levels of last March.
 
 After the Treasury's two-year note auction yesterday, traders said the issue was offered to yield about 14.02 percent, about the same as the lowest bid accepted at the auction. Treasury officials announced that the average price on the notes equaled 99.805, while the lowest accepted bid of 99.755 equaled a yield of 14.02 percent.Reluctance Among Buyers
 
 In other credit market activity yesterday, short- and long-term interest rates were little changed in quiet trading that dealers said showed continued uncertainty about future rate changes and the unwillingness of many investors to buy notes and bonds until inflation subsides.
 
 The problem of inflation was highlighted by the news of a 1 percent increase in the Consumer Price Index for October. Although that increase was expected by traders and did not cause any move to lower prices, they acknowledged that it was not good news for the bond market. The 12 percent annual inflation rate indicated by the rise in the index, if continued, would ultimatly mean still higher interest rates for long-term bonds, they explained.
 
 Until progress is made against inflation, many investors prefer to keep their funds in short maturities where yields are highest and where they do not risk the loss of principal if interest rates rise further. Illustrating the high yields available in the short-term market, investors are earning around 16 1/2 percent on 30-day commercial paper, which are unsecured obligations of large corporations.
 
 For six-month certificates of deposit, some of the largest banks were paying as much as 15.9 percent and 16 1/8 percent, while yields of nearly 17 percent were paid for three-month issues. Analysts say that such high bank rates indicate that further increases in the prime rate are likely. Short-Covering Boosts Prices
 
 Prices of notes and bonds were higher for much of the day, though analysts said prices were lifted by short-covering by active traders and not by an inflow of investor funds. A drop in the Federal funds rate to as low as 16 1/2 percent also encouraged some higher prices, on the thin hope that the funds rate may decline from the 17 percent level of recent days. Later in the day, however, the funds rate rose to 18 percent, and analysts said they remained very uncertain about future changes in the funds rate.
 
 In the intermediate- and long-term market, prices closed slightly lower. The Treasury's 13 percent notes due 1990, for example, were offered at 101 13/32, to yield 12.75 percent, and the 12 3/4 percent bonds due 2010 were offered at 103 13/32, to yield 12.31 percent.
 
 In Federal agency financing, the Farm Credit System announced interest rates for three bond issues totaling $3.7 billion. The $2.4 billion of six-month bonds are offered with a 15.35 percent coupon, the $794 million of nine-month bonds have a 14.9 percent coupon and the $521 million of two-year, nine-month bonds have a 13 3/4 percent coupon. All the issues are offered at par.
 
 Corporate bond underwriters said that about 75 percent of the Pennsylvania Power and Light Company's $125 million of Aa/A-rated 14 percent bonds due 1990 have been sold at the offering price of par after two days of sales. A 14 1/2 pe rcent coupon was assigned to a $25 million issue of Central Hudso n Gas and Electric bonds rated Baa/A, which underwriters led by Kidder, Peabody & Company are offering at par.
