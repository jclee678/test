AUTO SALES DOWN 18.1% Nov. 21 to 30

Total sales by the nation's Big Three auto makers fell 18.1 percent in late November from the comparable period a year earlier, largely because of the depressing effect of rising interest rates.
 
 The General Motors Corporation today reported the steepest drop in the final 10 days of November, when its sales plunged 20.5 percent on a daily selling ra te basis. New-car deliverie s at the Ford Motor Company dropped by 19.3 percent.
 
 The Chrysler Corporation, however, managed to squeeze out a 3 percent gain in the Nov. 21-30 period, which had seven selling days, compared with eight last year.
 
 Together, the three auto makers reported sales of 141,553, down from 197,342. Weakening Called Expected
 
 ''It looks like we're starting to see the weakening that we've been expecting,'' said Harvey Heinbach, an auto industry analyst at Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Inc. ''The figures for the last 10 days of November are a start of the reaction to the interest rate climb that we've been looking for.''
 
 Mr. Heinbach, who said that Merrill Lynch expected rising interest rates to depress auto sales for at least the next two months, added that consumer resistance to higher sticker prices on 1981-model cars might also be behind the sharp sales decline.
 
 He said that, in October, when sales were stronger, many of the new-car sales were 1980 models at close-out prices.25 Selling Days in 1979 Month
 
 Despite the sharp late-November sales decline, the three auto makers' deliveries fell only 7.3 percent on a daily rate basis for the entire month, The companies delivered 504,889 autos, down from 567,091 in November 1979, when there were 25 selling days, one more than this year.
 
 While both General Motors and Ford reported declines for the month, 6.5 percent and 14 percent, respectively, Chrysler said its deliveries rose 6.8 percent, its second monthly gain.
 
 Sales of imported cars totaled 167,300 in the month, up 6.3 percent on a daily selling rate basis from last year. That represented 24.4 percent of the American market, up from 21.6 percent in October but the second-lowest market share of the year.
 
 For the industry as a whole, however, the accelerating pace of declining sales comes after a few weeks of more hopeful results and represents the worst 10-day showing since the new models were introduced.
 
 On an annual basis, sales by the Big Three makers totaled 5.6 million in the Nov.  21-30 period, down from nearly 7 million units inmid-November.  For the entire month, the annual rate was 6.4 million units. Decline for American Motors
 
 The American Motors Corporation, which provides only monthly sales figures, posted a 22.9 percent decline in passenger car sales and a 50.3 percent drop in Jeep sales for the month over November 1979 rates. Sales of cars from Renault, which is in the process of buying a dominant share of A.M.C., were up 24 percent, but on sales of just 1,679 for the month.
 
 Volkswagen of America, meanwhile, continued to lag in sales of its Rabbit, a fuel-efficient car that earlier this year was posting an unbroken series of sales gains. Rabbit sales were off 23.3 percent for the last 10 days of November and 23 percent for the month, a result, according to analysts, of the growing competition in the subcompact segment of the market by less expensive, newly introduced 1981 models such as the Ford Escort and its twin, the Mercury Lynx.  Ford sold 25,300 of the little cars in November, or 4.8 percent of total American-made sales.
 
 Bennett E. Bidwell, vice president of Ford's car and truck group, disputed the widely held notion that a rising prime interest rate made it more expensive for car buyers to finance their purchases.  ''In actual practice,'' he said, ''most auto loan interest rates for individual buyers are controlled by state regulations and do not automatically rise with the prime.'' Imports' Strength Continues
 
 Imported cars showed continued strength for the month of November, rising 6.3 percent over November 1979, and gaining a 24 percent share of the domestic auto market for the month, compared with a 21.5 percent share a year ago.
 
 In the last 10 days of November, G.M. sold 90,780 autos, down from 130,513, while Ford's deliveries were 35,498, down from 50,237.  Chrysler's sales totaled 15,275, or 2,197 cars a day, compared with 16,952 last year, or 2,057 a day.
 
 For the month, G.M.'s sales were 329,793, down from 367,560, while Ford sold 122,356 cars, down from 148,109. Chrysler's deliveries totaled 52,740 units, up from 51,422.
