Bond investors are being trampled in the upward march of interest rates. Treasury bond prices dropped about two percentage points, a one-day loss matched only in the most hectic trading of last winter.  Precipitous price drops for bond futures halted trading on the Chicago Board of Trade and prompted margin calls. (Page D1.)
 
 Worries about the persistence of high money rates hurt stocks, too. Losers on the New York Stock Exchange outnumbered gainers 5-to-1.  The Dow Jones industrials fell 7.76, to 908.45, after late bargain hunting in energy, defense and blue-chip issues trimmed a 17-point drop. Volume rose from Wednesday. (D6.)
 
 Commodities also took a beating, with worries about money costs compounded by international political tensions, especially in Eastern Europe. (D9.)
 
 But the dollar, as expected, moved up and gold went down. The American currency closed at a two-year high of 2.0205 marks in New York, and even gained against sterling, reversing a recent trend.  Gold prices generally fell 5 percent and ended the day in New York at $544 an ounce. (D9.) The Economy
 
 Chemical Bank is trying to dull the sharp rise in interest costs for smaller businesses. It will permit them to borrow up to $100,000, paying only about 15 1/2 percent, although the prime rate is now 20 percent. Other banks, worried that high finance costs might drown some small companies, are following a similar policy. (D1.)
 
 Noncompetitive fixed-price sales of securities were approved by the S.E.C. The commission also tightened the rules on pricing the issues in an attempt to take the sting out of criticism that the system discriminates against small investors. (D1.) Ronald Reagan filled four key business and economic posts. Donald T. Regan, chairman of Merrill Lynch, was nomi nated Secretary of the Treasury; Representative David A. Stockman, a Michigan Republican, director of the Office of Management and Budg et; Malcolm Baldrige, chairman of Scovill, Commerce Secretary, and Andrew L. (Drew) Lewis Jr., a Pennslyvania businessman, Secretary of Transportation. (A1.)
 
 The designation of Mr. Regan brings to the Cabinet a maverick manager rather than a policy-oriented politician. But his performance as chairman of Merrill Lynch has been strong, colleagues say, and his international views clear-sighted. (A28 and D1.) Mr. Stockman favors an aggressive approach to inflation. (D2.) Profiles of Mr.  Baldrige and Mr. Lewis, a businessman who is a Republican Party official, and the four other Cabinet-level appointees. (A28 and A29.)
 
 The Government injected $270 million into synthetic fuel projects planned to reduce oil imports. The Energy Department picked 79 proposals to tap the $20 billion financing set up to prod output of 2 million barre ls daily of oil equivalent by 1992. (D13.) Companies
 
 A set of briefs leading to the antitrust trial of A.T.&T. were issued. In them the Justice Department narrowed its monopoly charges somewhat, but insisted that Bell untie its strings to its operating subsidiaries and manufacturing unit. Bell took three times as many pages to deny the charges totally. Trial is set for Jan. 15. (D1.)
 
 Imperial Oil is the latest to rein in an Alberta development project because of the continuing pricing dispute between the province and the Canadian Government. The Exxon affiliate said it would not proceed with its $400 million plan for added oil recovery unless it gets a higher price. (D3.)
 
 Delhi Oil is looking again at selling or merging the company next year. Its main assets are oil and gas property in Australia. Sedco and the Murchison family might be interested. (D3.)
 
 Lonrho's unwelcome pursuit of Harrods should be settled in January at an extraordinary shareholders meeting. (D1.) Today's Columns
 
 Ronald Reagan apparently accepts an aggressive anti-stagflation stand that has been urged on him by two advisers. This would be a departure from the traditional conservative Republican view that slimming the economy is a better cure for inflation than robust growth. Leonard Silk. Economic Scene. (D2.)
 
 Investors apparently have been scared away from Tampax because of the toxic shock syndrome that seems to affect some tampon users. The company worries that its stock price, now near a 12-month low, might attract takeover bids. But Tampax data indicate that sales remain strong, and optimistic earnings projections may be justified. Market Place. (D6.)
