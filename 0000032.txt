DOW SLIPS AMID PROFIT TAKING; RAILS AND OILS SHOW LOSSES


19801224T000000Z


The euphoria over a possible peak in interest rates evaporated yesterday as the stock market's broad barometers moved slightly lower. Analysts noted that persistent profit taking pared prices of many recent star performers.
 
 The Dow Jones industrial average, after soaring 21 1/2 points on Monday, eased 0.51, to 958.28. Its highest reading came at 10:30 A.M., when it was ahead 4 points. At that time, stocks were responding favorably to the Chase Manhattan Bank's one-point cut in its prime rate, to 20 1/2 percent. But other major banks failed to follow.
 
 The Professional Tape Reader, an advisory service, has said it ''strongly doubts'' that the current upswing will bring the Dow to 1,000.
 
 Bethlehem Steel, the best gainer among the 30 Dow stocks, rose 1 3/8, to 26 1/2.  Monday's surge in stock prices followed a surprise prime rate reduction, to 20 1/2 percent, from 21 percent, by the Wells Fargo Bank. Volume Rises to 55.3 Million
 
 Other averages that showed modest declines yesterday included the New York Stock Exchange's composite index and the American Stock Exchange's market value index. However, advancing issues showed a 3-to-2 advantage over declining stocks on the Big Board. Bond prices moved lower.
 
 Volume expanded to 55.3 million shares from the previous day's 52 million.  Weakness continued in energy stocks, a group that has scored spectacular gains over the last two years. These issues retreated in the face of higher prices posted at the wholesale level by several major refiners for gasoline and other petroleum products.
 
 Meanwhile, both Venezuela and Mexico announced price increases for crude oil.  Among international oils, Exxon, Texaco and Gulf dropped by more than a point apiece. Also moving lower were Phillips Petroleum, Standard Oil (Ohio), Atlantic Richfield, Union Oil of California, Conoco Inc., Standard Oil of California and Standard Oil (Indiana).
 
 One of Wall Street's leading advocates of energy stocks, David Snow, an analyst at A.G. Becker Inc., recently recommended that portfolio positions be trimmed ''moderately'' during any near-term periods of strength. Schlumberger Declines 4 1/8
 
 Schlumberger, an institutional favorite in the oil-service sector, retreated 4 1/8 points, to 118 5/8.
 
 Railroad stocks that had displayed particular strength in November also moved lower. Losses exceeding 3 points appeared in both Union Pacific and Burlington-Northern.
 
 Meanwhile, today represents the first session in which investors can establish profits for the 1981 tax year on a regular-way basis.  These transactions will clear five business days from today, on Jan.  2.
 
 Inasmuch as tax relief is expected to receive the blessings of the Reagan administration next year, the market may face a selling test today by investors who had postponed taking profits.
 
 Tax losses for 1980 may be taken right up to the closing bell on Dec. 31. Bank Stocks Advance
 
 J.P. Morgan continued to move ahead in the bank group, gaining 1 1/4, to 52, after selling at its highest price within the last year.  Chase Manhattan and BankAmerica also posted gains.
 
 Honeywell, also trading at its best price within the last 12 months, was a standout among computer issues. It rose 2 5/8, to 110 5/8, after advancing 2 3/8 Monday. One brokerage firm recently increased its earnings estimates for 1980 and 1981.
 
 The Federal National Mortgage Association gained 3/4, to 12 5/8.  The stock fell sharply after directors recently cut the dividend.  Along with such interest-sensitive groups as utilities, banks and insurance, Fannie Mae is regarded as a beneficiary of declining rates.
