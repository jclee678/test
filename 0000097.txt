Stunning losses were suffered on the nation's commodities exchanges yesterday in the third day of declines attributed largely to concern over the economy.
 
 At the Chicago Board of Trade, the world's largest futures trading exchange, grain prices dropped by the daily limit, and activity slowed to nearly nothing two hours before the scheduled 1:15 P.M.  close.
 
 The declines capped nine days of consecutive losses in the prices of grain futures. Traders had been saying since the beginning of the month that the selloffs were prompted by soaring interest rates and the fear that a flare-up of tensions between Poland and the Soviet Union could result in a total United States trade embargo against the Soviet Union.
 
 Metals prices on the Commodity Exchange in New York plummeted, with gold losing $25 a troy ounce in most contract months and silver losing as much as $1.31 an ounce under already expanded trading limits.
 
 Analysts said livestock futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which had resisted the doom pyschology Tuesday, dipped along with everything else yesterday, falling their daily allowable limit in all months, except in live cattle, where prices were mixed.
 
 ''I have been in this business for 30 years and I have never seen anything like this,'' said Jack Boyd, vice president of research at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. ''What the markets are telling you now is that the price of money is turning people away from commodities in ever increasing amounts to the point where they are now feeding on themselves.''
 
 Major banks across the country on Tuesday raised from 19 percent, to 20 percent, their prime lending rates -rates that are charged their most creditworthy corporate customers and that set the pace for other interest rates. Increasing interest rates make commodities less attractive because they make it more costly to finance the holding of commodity contracts and more costly to store the commodities.
 
 Analysts also said that while interest rates have been rising in recent weeks, many persons who had been investing in commodities abandoned them, putting their money instead into debt instruments.
 
 Oats on the Chicago board traded for only nine minutes before locking down the 6-cent allowable daily limit in all contract months at 9:30 A.M., traders said. Wheat reportedly locked at the 20-cent-abushel limit at about 10:30 a.m. And all months of soybeans were down the 30-cent limit and corn down their 10-cent limit by 11 A.M.
 
 At the close, January-delivery sobeans were $7.32 a bushel; December wheat was $4.28 a bushel; December corn was $3.43 a bushel; and December oats were $2.02 1/2 a bushel.
 
 Live cattle closed at 1.32 cents to 1.50 cents lower, December 64.40 cents a pound; feeders were 1.50 cents lower in all contract months, January 73.40 cents a pound; hogs were 1.50 cents lower in all months, December 46.67 cents a pound; pork bellies were 2 cents lower across the board, February 59.97 cents a pound.
 
 Silver prices settled the lowest they have been since early fall.  They moved down $1 in all but the December-delivery month where silver lost $1.31 to close $13.50 a troy ounce. Copper, which is particularly sensitive to increasing economic fears because it is used by the already depressed housing and auto industries, closed at 1.95 cents to 2.40 cents lower, December 77.80 cents a pound.  Platinum was $22 to $140 lower, January $525.
 
 Government National Mortage Association certificates were 42 to 64 ticks lower and United States Treasury bonds were 77 ticks lower in the current month and 64 ticks lower in all o thers. A tick represents$31.25 on a contract with a value of $100,000 .
