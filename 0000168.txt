The dollar rose slightly against most major currencies yesterday in quiet trading at home and abroad following the Thanksgiving holiday that closed United States markets Thursday. Gold prices were slightly higher in light trading in New York and London, and unchanged in Zurich.
 
 A New York currency dealer said the dollar continued to be buoyed by high United States interest rates. Federal funds, the interest on overnight loans of uncommitted reserves among commercial banks, traded as high as 20 percent yesterday in quiet activity.
 
 The prime lending rate of major commercial banks now ranges from 17 3/4 percent to 18 percent. ''But with the first sign of a downturn in interest rates, I think the dollar will start having problems,'' the dealer said.
 
 Gold sold at $624.60 a troy ounce, up $2 from Wednesday's close, in contracts for December delivery on New York's Commodity Exchange.  In later trading, gold was bid at $623 a troy ounce, up $2 from Wednesday, at the Republic National Bank in New York. Gold ended last week at $636.50 at the bank. Little News Cited
 
 One New York dealer said there was little news to stimulate trading, and many traders were absent, extending the Thanksgiving holiday into a four-day weekend.
 
 In London, bullion was priced at $622.50 a troy ounce, up 50 cents from Thursday's close but down from $636 at the end of last week. In Zurich, gold's price was unchanged from Thursday's price of $622.50 an ounce but was down from the $636.50-an-ounce close of last week.
