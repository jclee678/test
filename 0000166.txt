SELLERS OF MORTGAGE BONDS RACE CURBS

City and county governments are scrambling to sell tax-exempt housing revenue bonds as the prospect looms of Federal restrictions that would sharply curtail that source of low-interest mortgages for home buyers next year.
 
 With traditional mortgage rates at 15 percent and more and the housing industry in a slump, local governments have made extensive use of these tax-exempt bonds to help finance mortgages in the 11 to 12 percent range.
 
 The restrictions, proposed by a House-Senate conference committee, would limit the dollar volume of housing bonds sold by city, county and state agencies and the interest rate differential between the cost of the bonds and the mortgage rates offered to homeowners. In addition, the legislation would curb the use of the bonds for middleclass and luxury homes.
 
 The financial community expects that the legislation will be approved and take effect early next year.  Richard H. Locke, an executive vice president at E.F. Hutton & Company, said that ''I expect whatever Congress passes to substantially curtail issues of housing bonds by city and county governments next year.''
 
 State agencies will probably continue selling bonds, other investment bankers said, but they added that the state agencies were more oriented to low-income housing and housing in distressed areas.  The city and county issues tended to subsidize high-priced homes and the housing needs of the middle class, they said.
 
 When selling these tax-exempt mortgage bonds, the local or state authority turns over the money to private lending institutions at a relatively low cost, provided the money is lent at below-market intere st rates. Thus, the local authority is passing along the benefits of borrowing with tax-exempt status to the home buyer.
 
 The proposed legislation was spurred by fears that the proliferation of such borrowing would intensify what is already regarded as an excessive tax bias in favor of residential housing investments at the expense of industrial investments.
 
 The bonds were criticized by many as an unplanned, uncontrolled government subsidy to the middle class. Defending their right to sell the bonds, city and county governments said they were improving the public welfare by stimulating the economy and providing housing.
 
 Since the exact mortgage rates offered through this form of local government b o rrowing depend on the interest rate of the tax-exempt bonds, many c ommunities are worried that a flood of tax-exempt housing bonds before year-end could push yields even higher and undermine the ir efforts to make available low-cost home loans.
 
 ''I doubt that all the issuers who want to sell will be accommodated,'' said William Hayden, a managing partner at the First Boston Corporation. Other market participants have estimated that no more than $1 billion of bonds might be sold by year-end, though several billion worth might be proposed. 'Not Be Feasible' in 1981
 
 ''I heard of many towns that decided to immediately borrow whatever they could,'' Mr. Hayden said, ''because, after the first of the year, their issues will not be feasible.''
 
 Among the localities said to be planning bond sales soon are Pima and Pinel counties in Arizona; Lafayette, Jefferson, and Tammany parishes in Louisiana; San Leandro, Calif.; Tom Green County, Tex.; Los Alamos County and Albuquerque, N.M.; West Hartford, Conn., and St. Louis. Some of these localities have been planning bond sales for several weeks, but many others that have not yet been listed are also trying to sell bonds, investment bankers said.
 
 Housing revenue bonds of all types amounted to about $11.3 billion in the first 10 months of 1980, or about 28 percent of the new issues sold during that time, according to the Daily Bond Buyer, a publication specializing in the tax-exempt market. Some analysts said that, when issuing of housing bonds declined, their value would improve as they became a relatively scarce type of bond instead of an abundantly available one.New Techniques Proposed
 
 To increase investor demand during the flurry of bond issues, and to help home buyers obtain lower mortgage rates, several new financing techniques have been proposed. Ideas range from variable rates on bonds and mortgages to unusual pledges of financial backing by Citibank.
 
 One technique already used by Pinel County, Ariz., and planned for several other issuers in Arizona and Louisiana calls for Citibank to put its letter of credit behind a bond issue, and agree to retire any bonds that are still outstanding after 12 years in exchange for the remaining mortgages financed by the bond issue.
 
 According to E.F. Hutton's Mr. Locke, who invented tax-exempt housing revenue bonds for cities and counties in 1978, as many as $300 million of issues using a Citibank letter of credit may be sold by the end of the year.
