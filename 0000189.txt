RISE SLOWS IN DURABLES ORDERS

New orders for durable goods rose 1.3 percent last month, a far smaller increase than in September, as military spending fell off considerably, the Government said today.
 
 The $1 billion increase, to a seasonally adjusted $80.4 billion, followed a revised jump of 9.9 percent in September, the last month of the Government's 1980 fiscal year, when defense orders rose 43 percent.
 
 The two-month advance contrasts sharply with August's 2.7 percent decline in durable goods orders, when the economy was only beginning to emerge from a sharp recession.
 
 The orders from factories are adjusted for seasonal factors but not for inflation. Both wholesale and consumer prices accelerated at double-digit annual rates in October.
 
 ''Durable goods orders were heavily influenced by the month-tomonth movements in the defense category,'' the Commerce Department said. Defense orders declined $2.6 billion, or 40 percent, last month. Disregarding this area, new orders in October were up $3.6 billion, or 4.9 percent.
 
 The primary metals industries recorded their fifth consecutive monthly increase in new orders, the department said. A gain of $1.1 billion, or 8.8 percent, brought the October volume of metals orders to $13.7 billion, exceeding last January's high of $13.5 billion.
 
 New orders for machinery showed a $1 billion, or 4 percent, increase, to a seasonally adjusted $25.8 billion, the department said.
 
 Orders for transportation equipment, however, were down 16.6 percent, to $14.9 billion. ''Large declines in the aircraft and shipbuilding industries were only partially offset by an increase in the motor vehicles and parts industry,'' it said.
 
 The department also reported that shipments of durable goods rose 3.4 percent, or $2.6 billion, in October, to $79.2 billion, matching a monthly high set last February.
 
 September shipments, meanwhile, were revised up from an original 4.8 percent increase to a 6.3 percent jump.  Shipments of transportation equipment were up $1 billion, or 6.7 percent, to $16.4 billion, reflecting a jump in auto shipments as the new model year moved into full swing.
 
 Manufacturers also reported upswings in shipments of primary metals of 4.2 percent, to $11.8 billion, and of machinery of seven-tenths of 1 percent, to $25.2 billion.
 
 The continued rise in new durable goods orders meant even more unfilled orders by manufacturers than in September, the department said. Manufacturers' backlogs rose $1.2 billion, or four-tenths of 1 percent, last month, to a seasonally adjusted $276.3 billion, surpassing the previous high of $275.1 billion last April.
 
 The backlog of primary metals orders jumped 6.7 percent, to $29.6 billion. ''Although this is t he largest one-month percentage increase sinc e January 1979, the level is $1 billion less than in October 1979, '' the department said.
