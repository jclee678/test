TRADE GAP WIDER IN OCTOBER

The nation's trade deficit rose slightly in October to $1.86 billion, but the deficit for 1980 so far is still much less than it was at this time last year because of a steep drop in oil imports, the Commerce Department reported today.
 
 David Lund, an analyst for the department, said the trade gap for all of 1980 was likely to be slightly more than $32 billion, compared with the 1979 deficit of $37 billion.
 
 The improvement in the overall balance of trade is a factor in the stability of the United States dollar.  Both exports and imports increased during October, with exports rising 2.1 percent, to $19.09 billion, and imports going up 3 percent, to $20.94 billion. This left a deficit of almost $1.86 billion. The September deficit was $1.6 billion.
 
 The increase in the October deficit was attributed largely to a 7.3 percent increase in the value of imported oil to $6.16 billion, up from $5.75 billion in September. The volume of imported oil, 186 million barrels, was 5.8 percent more than in September. Higher Oil Price Noted However, Mr. Lund said, the growth of oil i mports reflected mainly the additional day in October (compared with September) and a rise of47 cents in the price of a barrel of oil, to $33.11. He said the overall trend of oil imports was still signif icantly below the 1979 pattern. In October of last year, oil imports totaled 273 million barrels.
 
 Imports in the first 10 months of 1980 totaled 2.06 billion barrels, down 23 percent from 2.55 billion barrels imported during the comparable period of 1979.
 
 The decline in oil imports is attributed to the recession and to conservation efforts, as well as to stockpiled oil that has given the country a reserve to draw on. ''Nobody is hurrying to grab onto a lot of oil at these prices,'' Mr. Lund told reporters. The October trade figures, the analyst said, showed that the recession in Europe had not hampered United States exports as much asmany had fear ed. Exports to Europe totaled $5.54 billion last month, up $171 milli on from the September level. The United States had a surplus in tr ade with Europe of $1.35 billion in October. Gap in Trade With OPEC
 
 As for this country's exports worldwide, Mr. Lund said, ''The export situation does not appear to have gone down the tubes, although it certainly has slowed up a little.''
 
 American exports to members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries rose $218 million last month, to $1.75 billion, although the United States still had a deficit of $2.66 billion in trade with these nations.
 
 The substantial deficit in trade with Japan also persisted. Imports totaled $2.83 billion in October, and exports were $1.8 billion, for a deficit of $1.03 billion. The previous month's gap was $1.16 billion.
 
 Auto imports were down slightly by $210 million, to a total of $1.28 billion.
