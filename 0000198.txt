U.N. GROUP URGES WORLD FOOD PLAN

As the world faces another shortage of grain, the United States should begin to use its food power to persuade other countries to establish grain reserves, an American advisory group to the United Nations has recommended.
 
 The group also suggested, among other recommendations, that the United States should not lift the grain embargo against the Soviet Union without asking Moscow to undertake a food reserve program that could help stabilize world food supplies and prices.
 
 The Economic Policy Council of the United Nations Association also warned that, unless the new administration urges other countries to build food reserves, next year could bring a serious shortfall of grain supplies and disastrous rises in food p rices.
 
 Released at News Conference
 
 Council officials released the recommendations for a new international food policy for the United States at a New York news conference on Friday.
 
 ''Our grain policy has to take into consideration our economic and political objectives, but we haven't done that,'' said Orville L.  Freeman, president of the Business International Corporation, a former Secretary of Agriculture and an originator of the council's food policy recommendations.
 
 ''The United States's position in the world grain markets is larger than OPEC's collective position in the oil markets, and it should be using that power for humanitarian purposes,'' added Robert O.  Anderson, chairman of the Atlantic Richfield Company, who also heads the council. He said that 60 percent of the grains and half of the oilseeds shipped in world trade each year originated in the United States.
 
 The council's report said that years of international negotiations to build a comprehensive international system of food reserves had failed to produce any results, a conclusion that was echoed by several high Agriculture Department officials at an annual world outlook conference in Washington last week. Despite - or because of - three years of good harvests, only the United States and India have established substantial grain reserves, Falling Behind Consumption
 
 At the same time, world grain production is rapidly falling behind consumption, by about 2 percent last season and by 3 percent in the 1980-81 season. As a result, stocks are shrinking, from 231 million metric tons in 1978-79 to an estimated 162 million tons by 1980-81.  (A metric ton equals about 2,205 pounds.) At the 1980-81 level, grain reserves would be about as low as they were in 1973-75, at the height of the world food shortage, according to the council report, which was largely produced by John Schnittker of Schnittker Associates, a Washington-based agricultural consulting concern.
 
 As a percentage of consumption, supplies will be even lower than in the mid-1970's. By mid-1981, stocks will represent only about 35 days' supplies, compared with 55 days last July 1 and about 40 days at the worst of the mid-1970's.
 
 In those years, grain prices tripled, and ''the same thing could happen again next year,'' Mr. Freeman said. He said that, if a crisis erupted next year, it would take the form not of actual famine but of dramatic price increases that could severely disrupt the world's already fragile international economic insitutions.
