O.E.C.D. SEES EASED RECESSION

Unemployment in industrial nations will increase over the next 18 months even though the current recession will begin to fade during the first six months of 1981, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said in a semiannual report, due to be issued tomorrow.
 
 The United States economy, the report said, will grow slightly over the same 18-month period, but with slim hope for any drop in inflation.
 
 Gross national product for the 24-nation group should rise by about 1.5 percent in the first half of 1981, 2.25 percent in the second six months of the year and 3 percent in the first half of 1982 -again, barring unexpected oil price rises, the O.E.C.D. said.
 
 The O.E.C.D.'s predictions, now being made for 18 months rather than 12, once again reflect rising oil prices and are based on the assumptions that government policies will not change and that exchange rates will remain stable.
 
 The agency acknowledges that, in going to an 18-month forecast, its predictions about what is going to happen in the first half of 1982 must be considered highly speculative. Oil Price Rise Put at 10 Percent
 
 Sylvia Ostry, an economist at the O.E.C.D., said at a news conference that the report had been compiled before the most recent meeting in Indonesia of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. But she said that meeting did not materially affect the report's findings.
 
 O.E.C.D. economists are predicting that the decision made in Indonesia will mean an oil price increase of around 10 percent at the start of 1981.
 
 The agency said that oil prices were up 150 percent in the 24 member nations of the O.E.C.D for the 18 months ending last June. At the same time, the report noted, reductions in spending and production among members have been much less than they were following the 1973-74 oil price explosion because ''business confidence and consequent investment have been maintained.''
 
 ''As long as there are no further oil price increases,'' the report said, ''this shock should substantially work through the system in the course of the current forecast period.''
 
 Unemployment in the O.E.C.D. area is expected to reach around 7.5 percent of the work force by early 1982, the report said. As in the past, the most severely affected will be young people, women and the elderly. The report noted in comparison that joblessness in the seven leading member nations -the United States, Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada - averaged about 4.4 percent in the 1970's.
 
 Turning back to the United States, the O.E.C.D. predicted an 8 percent jobless rate next year, down from 8.3 percent in 1980, with a further drop to about 7 3/4 percent in 1981. Gross national product in the United States should grow by three-quarters of a percent next year, just about what it lost in 1980, but the O.E.C.D. says it should jump 3 1/2 percent in the first half of 1982. Inflation Levels Will Persist
 
 The agency said that these forecasts depended on the speed with which the Reagan administration introduced new economic and monetary policies. The President-elect's promise to cut taxes by 10 percent a year for the next three years should increase both private consumption and industrial growth, the O.E.C.D. said.
 
 Even so, the O.E.C.D. predicted, interest rates probably will remain high and act as a barrier to any sustained economic recovery in the United States.
 
 The report concludes that inflation in the group will continue to be strong but will slacken slightly. It should subside gradually from a peak of 11 3/4 percent in the first half of 1982. One of the keys to containing or shrinking inflation will be in achieving a more moderate pattern of wage increases when the recession begins to end.
 
 The grimmest prognostications in the report were reserved for Britain, the forecast for which was published yesterday, and the developing nations.
 
 Developing nations that lack any oil resources will experience an increase in their total balance-of-payments deficit of some 20 percent, from $50 billion, to $60 billion, over the coming 18 months, according to Miss Ostry.
