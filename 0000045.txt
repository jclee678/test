Export-Credit Talks Fail

Major Western industrial nations and Japan failed Friday night to agree on new interest rates for official export credits after a two-day meeting, Robert Cornell, the chief United States delegate, said.
 
 Mr. Cornell told reporters that the United States would now raise its rates on these credits to near the level of interest rates on United States domestic markets in order to reduce the subsidies it has to pay its exporters.
 
 Mr. Cornell blamed the European Common Market countries for the failure of the talks but Common Market delegates said the United States and Japan had also been unwilling to change their bargaining positions.
 
 Sources said the United States wanted the interest rates charged for official export credits to be raised automatically to the levels prevailing on world financial markets while the E.E.C. has offered an increase of eight-tenths of 1 percent to 1 percent.
 
 Japan, whose domestic market rates are lower than those in most other countries, does not want to raise its rates for official credits.
 
 The credits are guarantees and loans given by governments to exporters or their clients to ease the financial burden of trading.  Interest rates now run from 7 1/2 percent to 8 3/4 percent.
