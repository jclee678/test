The stock market finished practically unchanged in slower trading yesterday as Wall Street's concern over rising i nterest rates and worsening tensions about Eastern Europe and t he Middle East weakened buying interest.
 
 The Dow Jones industrial average, which moved in a narrow price range throughout the session, closed down 2.13, to 972.27. However, winners on the New York Stock Exchange just barely outscored losers by 784 to 779.
 
 Analysts said the rise in interest rates again discouraged stock buying yesterday. On Tuesday, many of the nation's largest banks raised their prime lending rates, the rates they charge their key corporate customers for loans, to 18 1/2 percent from 17 3/4 percent. A month ago the prime stood at 14 1/2 percent and many analysts expect it soon to rise to 20 percent.
 
 Other depressants for the market were Jordan's rejection of Syria's plan for ending their border crisis and the possibility that the Soviet Union may decide to intervene militarily in Poland in order to end the crisis in that country.
 
 ''The market is still consolidating its post-election gains and appears to be preparing for a year-end rally,'' commented Newton D.  Zinder, first vice president of E.F. Hutton & Company.
 
 However, Mr. Zinder said that traders were likely to move cautiously until there was some evidence ''of a peak in interest rates.''
