Buffeted by credit controls, changes and differences in Federal and state usury laws and the rising cost of funds, major credit card operations are experiencing their most unsettled year since the recession of 1974-75.
 
 Estimates vary about how much the members of Visa and Interbank (MasterCard), the nation's major credit card associations, could lose this year.
 
 Dee W. Hock, president of Visa, which has more cardholders than Interbank, estimated that if credit controls had remained in place, the total could have reached $1 billion nationwide.
 
 An estimate released two weeks ago by major New York banks, which have been subject to strict usury laws, predicted they would lose a total of $500 million on both cards.
 
 It will be some time before the full extent of the damage is known. Second-quarter information is still being com-piled. Mr. Hock acknowledged that Visa was running ''about 5 or 6 months behind'' collecting data from its members.
 
 Most observers agree that New York's decision this month to abolish usury laws will have far-reaching effects on the business, and could lead to national pre-emption of usury ceilings. Few think higher interest rates in the short term will lead to a huge exodus away from plastic, however.
 
 According to Mr. Hock, roughly half of all Visa accounts are in states where usury ceilings have been raised or eliminated. ''So far,'' he says, ''few are turning in their cards.''
 
 Data Resource economist Elizabeth Allison thinks that demographics favor continued use of bank cards. ''The 25 to 35 age group are the heaviest users now. They've grown up with inflation. It seems unlikely they would turn their backs on credit cards now.''
