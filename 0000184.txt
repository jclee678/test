COUNSELOR TO REAGAN SAYS TAX CUT WILL BE FIRST PRIORITY AFTER JAN. 20

An individual tax cut as part of a comprehensive economic program will be the new administration's ''first priority'' after it takes office Jan. 20, a senior associate of President-elect Ronald Reagan said today. Edwin Meese 3d, counselor to Mr. Reagan, said at a news conference at the transi tion headquarters here that since the lame-duck Congresshad decided n ot to enact a tax cut this year, it would be at the top of the new ad ministration's legislative agenda. He said the income tax cut would be ''along the lines'' of the 30 percent, three-year reduction tha t Mr. Reagan had advocated in the campaign.
 
 Mr. Meese's comments came after several days of conflicting accounts from different Reagan advisers about the President- elect's proposed budget cuts and spending levels. His remarks seemed designedas a reassurance that, whatever else happened , the new administrationplanned to honor its tax-cut promises. Broad Range of Questions
 
 The counselor, who will have Cabinet rank in the Reagan administration and is expected to coordinate foreign and domestic policy, answered a broad range of questions on the transition process while Mr. Reagan relaxed at his ranch in California. The Presidentelect is expected to spend Thanksgiving at the ranch and return to Los Angeles on Friday.
 
 Mr. Meese also made these points:
 
 - It will be at least next week, the following week, and possibly the third week in December before any Reagan Cabinet appointments will be made publiic. He declined to say whether Mr. Reagan had already made up his mind on any of the Cabinet appointments.
 
 - Three weeks into the transition, the process is going smoothly and is, ''if anything, a little ahead of schedule.'' He said that he and his staff were in ''continual contact'' with the Carter transition team, but at the moment no further meeting was scheduled between Mr. Reagan and President Carter.
 
 - As President, Mr. Reagan will press the Federal Reserve Board to insure ''monetary stability'' with its policies on interest rates.
 
 - Senator Charles F. Percy of Illinois, who will be chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee when the Republicans take control of the Senate next January, carried ''no messages other than the social idea of good wishes'' from Mr. Reagan when he met today with Leonid I.  Brezhnev, the Soviet leader. However, Mr. Meese confirmed that Senator Percy had met with Reagan foreign policy advisers before his trip to Moscow and ''will be able to generally reflect the views of the President-elect.''
 
 - Despite his ''social and unofficial'' meeting in Washington last week with Chancellor Helmut Schmidt of West Germany, Mr. Reagan intends to abide by his decision not to confer with foreign leaders prior to the inauguration.
 
 - Despite Mr. Reagan's remarks yesterday that he basically agreed with a report by his energy advisers recommending the removal of price controls on oil and natural gas, the President-elect has made no ''specific decision'' on whether to accelerate the phased decontrol process instituted by Mr. Carter. That process, already under way, is designed to lift the final controls in stages by next September.
 
 Privately, some Reagan aides expressed concern today about the continued delay in the announcement of Cabinet appointments. The speculation on possible names has led to a spate of rumors and articles about Reagan policies that, in the words of one aide, ''are well ahead of the facts.''
 
 Nonetheless, Mr. Meese stressed today that Mr. Reagan was determined to give every appointment full consideration and that none would be disclosed officially until it was ready.
