The dollar scored gains against most key currencies yesterday as major United States banks raised their prime lending rates. Gold prices declined.
 
 The loan rate went from 17 percent, to 17 3/4 percent, at most major banks. Wells Fargo, a California bank, pushed its prime up to 18 percent. Higher American interest rates ma ke dollar holdings relatively more attractive than other currenc ies, thus raising the dollar's value.
 
 Gold fell $5.40, to $622.60 a troy ounce in current delivery contracts traded on the Commodity Exchange in New York. At the Republic National Bank, gold was bid at $621 an ounce, down $5 from Tuesday's late bid.
 
 In earlier European markets, the price of gold rose by $9 in Zurich to close at $625.50 a troy ounce. In London, the metal closed at $624.50 an ounce, up $2.75. Polish Situation a Factor
 
 In addition to the higher interest rates, currency dealers in Europe said the dollar was aided by renewed rumors of impending military action by the Soviet Union in Poland. Last week, unfounded rumors of Soviet moves into Poland had some effect on trading.
 
 The pound, which fell sharply on Monday as the British Government lowered the Bank of England's lending rate, co ntinued to recover in London but no t in New York yesterday.
 
 In London, the pound rose to $2.3665, from Tuesday's closing rate of $2.3550. In New York, the pound traded at $2.3587, unchanged from Tuesday's late rate.
