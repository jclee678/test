Commercial and industrial loans at the major New York City banks rose by $358 million in the week ended Dec. 17, but, in terms of the domestic economy, the increase was not so great as it appeared because a third of it represented loans to foreign businesses.
 
 In its weekly report, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said yesterday that commercial and industrial loans on the books of the 10 leading New York banks reached $51.3 billion.
 
 Of the $358 million rise in business lending during the week, $119 million was to addresses outside the United States, the Federal Reserve said. This brought the level of foreign loans at the New York banks to $2.38 billion, the highest since Jan. 10, 1979, when such loans totaled $2.4 billion.
 
 The rise in loans to domestic companies amounted to $239 million, and brought the total to $48.9 billion. Economists Uncertain
 
 Changes in business borrowing from banks are considered by many economists to be an important indicator of economic activity. At times, however, as at present, economists are not certain whether heavy borrowing represents a buoyant economy or the onset of a recession.
 
 When business is robust, companies borrow heavily to obtain the funds needed to increase inventories and expand production. But at the start of a recession, companies must borrow because of a decline in cash flow resulting from lower sales and the need to finance unsold inventories.
 
 Economists have been watching business loan figures particularly carefully in recent weeks to determine whether the high level of interest rates might be bringing on a recession.
 
 To determine what the domestic economy is doing, economists must subtract the amount of foreign lending from the total increase in commercial and industrial loans.
 
 However, while domestic lending to companies by the New York banks rose $239 million in the Dec. 17 week, there was a sharp decline in business borrowing in the commercial-paper market, the second consecutive drop. Companies lend among themselves in the commercialpaper market.
 
 In the week to Dec. 17, according to the Fed, borrowings by nonfinancial companies from the commercial-paper market dropped $888 million. In the previous week, such loans fell $815 million. And in the last four weeks, borrowings by nonfinancial companies from the commercial-paper market declined almost $1 billion. Such borrowings totaled $38 billion in the week ended Dec. 17.
