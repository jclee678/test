Gold and silver prices dropped sharply yesterday as the prime lending rate climbed a full percentage point to a record 21 percent at most American banks.
 
 The dollar, which has surged in recent days as United States interest rates have climbed, finished the day mixed in New York despite the prime rate increase.
 
 Dealers said an increase of as much as $4 per 42-gallon barrel in the oil prices of the Organizaton of Petroleum Exporting Countries, announced after an oil ministers' meeting in Indonesia, had little impact on gold or foreign exchange trading.
 
 The rise in the rate banks charge on loans to their most creditworthy customers ''was anticipated by the market,'' said one currency trader, who noted that the dollar ''really is a lot firmer'' than it was at its lowest point on Monday.
 
 On bullion exchanges here and abroad, ''prices fell as the prime went to 21,'' a trader said. The wave of increases began late in the afternoon for Europeans and helped send the price of gold down $20.25 an ounce in London, to $558.25. In Zurich, gold fell $16, to $563.50.
 
 Gold for December delivery dropped $7, to $566.60, on the Commodity Exchange Inc. in New York. Republic National Bank of New York quoted gold in later dealings at $567, off $8.
 
 Silver fell 70 cents an ounce in London, to $14.45, and dropped 40 cents an ounce, to $14.79, on the Comex in New York.  The dollar, which fell as low as 1.95 West German marks Monday, was quoted at 4 P.M. in New York yesterday at 2.0040 marks, up from Monday's late rate of 2.0012.
 
 Other late New York dollar rates included: 4.64 French francs, down from 4.65; 1.8150 Swiss francs, up from 1.8110; 208.50 Japanese yen, down from 208.97; and 1.2078 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2079.
 
 Late European dollar rates included: Paris, 4.6825 French francs, up from 4.5925; Milan, 956 Italian lire, up from 937; Frankfurt, 2.0165 marks, up from 1.9772; Zurich, 1.8280 Swiss francs, up from 1.7950; Amsterdam, 2.1920 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1505.
 
 In Tokyo, where markets closed before the increase in the United States prime rate was announced, the dollar finished at 209.40 yen, up from 208 yen Monday.
 
 The British pound fell in London to $2.31175, from $2.3270. In New York, the pound dropped to $2.3132, from $2.32.
