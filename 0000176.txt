U.S. AND TRADE PARTNERS CLASH ON EXPORT CREDITS

The United States and Western Europe failed today to agree on changes in the rules governing the low-interest credits used to promote exports, inching closer to a new trade war over the subsidies.
 
 After two days of inco nclusive discussions at the Organization for Economic Coop eration and Development, officials for the major Westernnations exten ded their Dec. 1 deadline for agreement and decided to meet again De c. 18 in another effort to reach a settlement.
 
 The Carter Administration has threatened to retaliate agai nst European governments - and particularly Franc e - for the low-cost export credits they continue to give.
 
 Washington has already warned it might lengthen from 10 years to 15 or 20 years the maturity of loans that the United States Export-Import Bank gives buyers of American goods, a step Europe would find it expensive to match.
 
 Whether the incoming Reagan administration would do the same remains uncertain. But it will be under pressure to do so from sections of American industry and from its allies in the Congress.Talks 'Not Very Encouraging'
 
 The chairman of today's meeting, Axel Wallen of Sweden, described discussions as ''not very encouraging,'' saying that participants had not moved from the initial incompatible positions.
 
 But the chief American negotiator, Deputy Assistant Treasury Secretary Robert Cornell, said he was still hopeful an agreement could be reached in three weeks.
 
 Washington complains that Western Europe, at French insistence, is refusing to honor the pledge all Western nations made at a Venice economic meeting last June to raise the subsidized interest rate they charge on export credits closer to market rates.
 
 It regards as ''totally unacceptable'' the increase of six-tenths to one percentage point that the nine Common Market countries offered earlier this month. That would bring interest rates on export credits to rich and middle-rich countries to 9.5 or 9.75 percent, depending on maturity; for developing countries, the rate would be 8.1 or 8.35 percent. Both levels would still be well below prevailing market rates of 10 to 12 percent. U.S. Viewpoint Changes
 
 The United States first favored setting minimum interest rates for export credits in each major currency, which would have virtually eliminated the subsidy element.
 
 But it is now prepared to continue with the current ''matrix system,'' which sets a common rate for a group of currencies, provided it is tied more closely to ruling market rates.
 
 Eight of the nine Common Market countries, which negotiate as a group in trade matters, are basically sympathetic with this position.  But France wants to retain more flexibility to subsidize its exports at a time of slowing world trade and increasing competition for orders. France, which feels itself a late arrival on the industrial scene, has always viewed government aids and subsidies as an important tool in achieving its declared aim of becoming a major industrial power with a strong export sector.
 
 While the Ex-Im Bank has difficulty matching the credits European governments can give their exporters because it is mainly funded in the private capital market, it can offer longer maturities. However if the United States does this, according to officials here it would be breaking the spirit, if not the letter, of the existing agreement on credits, which limits maturities to 10 years in principle.
