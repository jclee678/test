INVENTORY RATIO IMPROVES

The value of inventories held by American businesses rose slightly in October, while the rate of sales increases slowed from recent months, the Commerce Department reported today.
 
 Inventories increased by six-tenths of 1 percent, or $2.8 billion, to a seasonally adjusted $457.3 billion, the department said. The percentage increase was the same as in September.
 
 Sales by manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers were up 2.2 percent in October, or $7.2 billion, to $325.5 billion. Sales in September rose $10.3 billion, or 3.3 percent. No Adjustment for Inflation
 
 The figures are not adjusted for inflation, although much of the increase in inventories and sales was attributable simply to higher prices.
 
 The ratio of inventories to sales continued to decline from recession levels, dropping to 1.40, down from 1.43 in September and the lowest point since February. That means it would take businesses 1.4 months at the current pace of sales to dispose of their stocks.  The ratio was 1.42 in October 1979.
 
 The size of inventories is watched closely as an indicator of the health of the economy. Excessive supplies of goods on the shelf lead to reduced production and employee layoffs. A decline in inventories can point to increased hiring.
 
 Wholesalers accounted for $1.6 billion of the inventory buildup in October, while retail inventories rose by $1.5 billion.  Manufacturers' inventories dropped $300 million.
 
 Stocks of durable goods - those expected to last three years or longer -increased $1 billion, to $275.7 billion. Nondurable goods rose to $181.7 billion from $179.9 billion. Auto Inventories Up
 
 Despite rising interest rates, automobile dealers built their inventories slightly in October to $24.4 billion after a 12.8 percent decline the previous month.
 
 The value of retail stocks of building materials, hardware and mobile homes rose 1.3 percent, to $9.2 billion, following a slight decline in September.
 
 But sales declines were recorded by both the automobile and building industries in October. As a result, the retail supply of automobiles rose to a level that would take 1.71 months to sell, up from 1.65 in September.
 
 Inventories of building materials in October increased to a 2.18-month supply from a 2.14-month supply in September.
