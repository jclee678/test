Grain futures prices closed mixed yesterday in what analysts said was light activity before the Christmas observance.  Wheat settled lower, while oats, corn and soybeans were higher on the Chicago Board of Trade. Sources said local traders were dominant in all the trading pits, but substantial commercial selling contributed to the downward movement in wheat.
 
 Commercial interest was almost totally lacking in soybeans and oats, where commission houses were said to be both buying and selling.
 
 Traders said there was some support from news of declining interest rates. The Wells Fargo Bank, the nation's 11th-largest commercial bank, reduced its prime lending rate yesterday to 20 1/2 percent.
 
 It was the first prime rate reduction by a major bank since July, and came after a smaller St. Louis bank cut its rate to 20 percent.  Just last Friday most major banks raised their prime rate to 21 1/2 percent, a record for the rate. Wells Fargo was one of the few banks to hold the line at 21 percent.
 
 At the close, soybeans were 1/2 cent to 9 cents higher, Janaury $7.93 a bushel; oats were 1 cent to 4 1/4 cents higher, March $2.23 1/2 a bushel; wheat was 2 1/4 cents to 5 1/4 cents lower, March $4.87 a bushel; corn was 2 cents to 4 1/2 cents higher, March $3.79 1/4 a bushel. Cotton Prices Rise
 
 Cotton prices were lifted mainly on technical factors, according to Ron Kimmel, analyst with Bache Halsey Stuart Shields Inc.
 
 Pam Rockley of Drexel, Burnham, Lambert Inc., said new buying also was sparked by news of the declining prime rate, and by reports that China is buying large quantities of cotton this month after having been out of the market since May.
 
 Cotton closed .77 cent to 1.90 cents higher, March 95.95 cents a pound.  Analysts said that prices in the livestock market were mixed, with traders said to be waiting for the Government hog and pig crop report due Tuesday.
 
 At the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, pork bellies were .23 cent to .45 cent lower, February 63.22 cents a pound; hogs were .67 cent lower to .50 cent higher, February 51.92 cents a pound; live cattle were .33 cent lower to .10 cent higher, January 66.70 cents a pound; feeders were .05 cent to .65 cent higher, January 74.30 cents a pound.
 
 Interest rate futures were higher for the second day, on the hopes that the prime rate was finally peaking, analysts said.  Treasury Bonds were 48 ticks to the daily allowable limit of 64 ticks higher, and Government National Mortgage Associations certificates were 23 ticks to 40 ticks higher. A tick represents $31.25 on a contract with a face value of $100,000.
 
 Metals prices closed mixed.  At the close, gold was $2.10 to $12.60 lower, December $592.20 a troy ounce; silver was 28 to 39 cents lower, December $15.87 a troy ounce; copper was .10 cent lower to .30 cent higher, December 84.25 cents a pound; platinum was $56 to $101 lower, December $577 a troy ounce.
