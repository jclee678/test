The prime lending rate of large banks rose to 21 1/2 percent amid signs the upward spiral of interest rates may be ending. ''This could be the last gasp'' of rising interest rates, said Norman Robertson, a senior vice president at the Mellon National Bank. Rising interest rates are the main reason most economists expect a slump in 1981. The credit markets gave one indication that interest rates may be turning down at last. Treasury bills, for example, plunged 1 1/2 percentage points. The outlook for a rate decline was strengthened when the Federal Reserve reported that the basic money supply, M-1B, slipped $1.6 billion in the week ended Dec. 10. (Page 1.)
 
 Orders and shipments of durable goods increased in November, but at slower rates than in the previous two months, the Commerce Department said.

Economists attributed the deceleration to rising interest rates.  Shipments of manufactured durable goods increased $700 million, or eight-tenths of 1 percent, to $80.2 billion in November. (31.)

 The stock market rose 7 points to 937.20, ending the week with a 20-point gain. General Motors led the way, rising 3 1/4 points to 44 7/8, as hopes that interest rates are nearing their peak once again dominated investor psychology. (35.)
