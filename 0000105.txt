Commodities futures prices fell sharply over a broad front for the second consecutive day yesterday after major banks raised their prime lending rates to 20 percent, matching the record set earlier this year.
 
 Some metals, grains and cotton prices moved down the daily allowable limit. Analysts noted that higher interest rates made it more costly to finance commodity purchases and to store commodities in inventory.
 
 Soybeans, which closed 13 1/2 to 30 cents lower on the Chicago Board of Trade yesterday, have lost about $2 a bushel in the past week, leaving the January-delivery contract at $7.62; wheat was 1 1/2 cents to 11 1/4 cents lower, December $4.48 a bushel; corn was 5 1/2 cents to 8 1/ 2 cents lower, December $3.53 a bushel; oats were 5 cents to 6 ce nts lower, January $2.08 a bushel.
 
 Robert House, metals analyst with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, said silver and gold were pushed lower in selling influenced by the offshoots of high interest rates - a strengthened dollar and new prospects for a recession. Livestock Prices Ended Mixed
 
 On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold was $25 to $26.30 lower, December $565 a troy ounce; silver was 75 cents to $1.69 lower, December $14.81 an ounce; copper was 2.50 cents to 3.30 cents lower, December 79.95 cents a pound; platinum was $49 lower to $70 higher, December $547 a troy ounce.
 
 Livestock prices closed mixed as cattle took strength from higher noon beef prices and gave support to nearby-month hog prices.  In feeder cattle, some buying may have been encouraged on the reasoning that feed lot operations could be expanded if feed grain prices are lower, said Bob Kuhn, an analyst with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith.
 
 On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, live cattle were 0.45 cent lower to 0.18 cent higher, December 65.72 cents a pound; feeders were 0.48 cent lower to 0.65 cent higher, January 74.90 cents a pound; hogs were 1.50 cents lower to 0.05 cents higher, December 47.90 cents a pound; pork bellies were 1.55 cents to 1.75 cents lower, February 61.97 cents a pound.
 
 Coffee prices got an extra shove on their way down from news that legislation providing for United States participation in the international coffee agreement was stalled in the Senate, analysts said.
 
 On the New York Cotton Exchange, cotton closed two-tenths of a cent to 2 cents lower, March 91.62 cents a pound.  On the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York, coffee was 0.38 cent to 2.70 cents lower, December 114.25 cents a pound; sugar was 0.38 cent lower to 0.29 cent higher, January 28.69 cents a pound; cocoa was $8 to $37 lower, December $1,915 a metric ton.
