50,000 JOBS ARE LOST IN NEW YORK REGION

The recession this year cost the New York-northeastern New Jersey area 50,000 jobs, the first decline in total jobs in five years. But New York City, which was hit hard in the two prior national recessions, fared better in 1980, losing only 12,000 jobs, for a decline of 0.4 percent, according to a year-end review by the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics.
 
 Unemployment rates changed little over the year - 7.4 percent for the overall region and 8.7 for the city. The figures continued to be higher than the national rate, which rose from 5.8 percent in 1979 to 7.1 percent this year, according to Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, regional commissioner of the bureau.
 
 Consumer prices in the New York area, he noted, rose at a 10.4 percent annual rate, seasonally adjusted, between December 1979 and October 1980, after a 10.6 percent increase for the year ended in December 1979.
 
 Mr. Ehrenhalt said, however, that the inflation rate of the New York area continued, for the fourth consecutive year, to be less than the national rate of 12.6. Food Increase a Factor
 
 On the whole, he said, the area fared better than the rest of the country. He attributed the better performance during the first six months of the downturn to lower concentrations of industries sensitive to recession, such as durable-goods manufacturing and contract construction, which were particularly hard hit nationally.
 
 During the latter part of 1980, food price increases replaced energy as a prime factor in the cause of inflation, in the New York area, he said. With sharp advances for meat and poultry, the price index of food items purchased for home consumption rose at a 22.3 percent seasonally adjusted annual rate during the three months ended in October.
 
 This surge, Mr. Ehrenhalt said, contrasted with lower prices for fuel and utilities in the three months ended in October.  The steep price rise of the last year more than offset increases in the gross average weekly earnings of the area's factory workers, he said, resulting in substantial reductions in purchasing power. Buying Power Declines
 
 Based on data for the first 10 months of each year, gross average weekly earnings of the New York area's factory workers rose by $20.31, or 8.2 percent, between 1979 and 1980 to $266.85. Buying power of factory workers' take home pay, he said, declined by 3.8 percent in the area over the year.
 
 The job decline of 50,000 ended four years of recovery in which 400,000 jobs had been added in the region. In October, payroll employment for the region was 6,656,700 and for New York City, 3,281,800.
 
 New York City's 1980 recession experience, he said, was much better than in the last two national economic downturns, when the city suffered disproportionately severe job losses. In the 1969-70 and 1973-75 national recessions, he said, the rate of job losses for the city was more than triple the national figure. The city's job decline was 117,000, or 3.1 percent, in the 1969-70 downturn and 204,000, or 5.8 percent, in the 1973-75 recession.
