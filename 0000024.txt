It would be ''unwise'' to declare an economic emergency, Arthur F.  Burns, former Federal Reserve Board chairman and an adviser to Ronald Reagan, told a news conference. His remarks were seen as evidence that members of the incoming administration are now backing away from the idea. Several Reagan aides had suggested the measure last week to combat inflation. In another swipe at Mr. Reagan's economic proposals, Mr. Burns, as chairman of the Committee to Fight Inflation, a group of 13 Federal economic officials, also called for lower business taxes this year, but opposed a three-year, 30 percent cut.

They may, however, require differences in the level of training. Technology. (36.)
