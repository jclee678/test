MICHIGAN SLASHING SPENDING AS AUTO ILLS HURT ECONOMY

The State of Michigan and the thousands of agencies, institutions and local governments that depend on it for financial support have started another major cutback of payrolls and services as the economic downturn in the automobile industry erodes tax collections and increases the costs of social programs.
 
 If all of the anticipated $288 million in reductions are achieved, the state will have cut about $1 billion from its budget since spring, representing a 20 percent reduction in its spending against the previous fiscal year. It will represent still another blow to a state economy already reeling from huge layoffs and production cutbacks by the nation's major automobile companies, all of which are based in Michigan, and thousands of smaller suppliers scattered across the state.
 
 Hardly any potential area for saving is being spared. The state troopers have agreed to a 5 percent salary cut, and support for education is being slashed. Also proposed is a 10 percent cut in spending for welfare, raising the prospect that thousands of laid-off workers will receive another jolt to their income.
 
 Alternative to Tax Increases
 
 ''We are beyond fat and into the bone,'' said Gov. William G.  Milliken, the popular moderate Republican who announced his most recent plans for budget cuts earlier this month in an address that was televisied statewide. He said the budget cuts were being proposed as an alternative to increasing taxes because of the outcome of the Nov. 4 national election and the voters' reaction to state taxation propositions on the ballot.
 
 Leaders of the Democratic majority controlling both houses of the State Legislature have differed very little with Mr. Milliken about the actions he has proposed, many of which must receive legislative approval by Jan. 1. Meanwhile, many of the steps that would have to be taken for the state to live within its new fiscal realities have already been taken.
 
 The proposals include a further $75 million cut in state aid to higher education, and all major state-controlled colleges and universities plan to furlough most of their employees for at least four days without pay. Hiring freezes are in effect almost across the board, and many programs that are not considered essential are being dropped. Pay Cuts at Wayne State
 
 Wayne State University, the state's principal urban campus, has ordered pay cuts for all administrative officers of the school who earn $40,000 or more a year. The pay reductions range in magnitude from 10 percent for Thomas Bonner, the college president, who receives $67,500, to 5 percent for those at the $40,000 level.
 
 The cuts are certain to further erode Michigan's standing in state aid to higher education. A decade ago it was in the top 10 among the 50 states and now is in the bottom 10.
 
 The Michigan State Police Troopers Association, representing about 2,000 troopers and sergeants, signed an agreement with the state this week calling for its members to take a 5 percent pay cut to avoid the layoff of 127 troopers and to provide for the recall of 80 others laid off earlier. The Governor had proposed a $4 million cut in the state police budget.
 
 Other proposals include deferral until next fiscal year of pay increases for top elected and appointed state officials and a cut of $65 million in state general aid to elementary and secondary schools, bringing the total reduction in aid for these schools to $223 million against a year earlier. $23 Million in Welfare Savings
 
 Mr. Milliken's proposal for a 10 percent cut in the level of support for welfare recipients would save $23 million; cutbacks in the State Department of Natural Resources and a delay in providing aid to financially distressed Wayne County as part of a county government reorganization plan would save $15.4 million more.
 
 For the Detroit school board, which faces the loss of nearly $21 million under the proposed cuts, the cutbacks present an irony.  Detroit voters bucked the trend against tax-related items on the Nov. 4 ballot and approved a property tax increase that would raise some $35 million in badly needed revenue, much of it coming from the state in the form of matching funds.
 
 The vote resulted in the immediate recall of about 500 teachers laid off at the start of the school year and averted the layoff of 200 more. School officials have said that if all of the proposed state cuts are carried out, they might be for ced to lay the teachers off again and cut the already bare-bones acad emic programs even more.  Michigan le ads the nation in unemployment with 13.4 percent of its workforce job less. Among blue-collar workers employed by the automobile in dustry in Michigan, about 184,000 are still on indefinite la yoff and thousands of salaried employees and employees of supplier c ompanies in much the same situation.
