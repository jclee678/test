COMMODITIES;Futures Start Correcting, But Recovery Is Stalled

A recovery in grain and metals prices was stalled yesterday as another rise in interest rates brought fears of a recession back to the futures markets.
 
 Major banks raised their prime lending rates a full percentage point to a record 21 percent. Last Wednesday, banks across the nation had raised the prime rate a full percentage point, to 20 percent, matching the peak reached last spring, when the economy was dipping into a recession. That rate was said to have caused last week's dramatic selling, which sent commodities into one of the sharpest declines on record.
 
 Analysts note that higher interest rates make it more costly to maintain commodity inventories and finance commodity positions and they encourage people to put their money into interest-bearing investments instead.
 
 Analysts also noted the strengthened United States dollar eases export demand. Oversold Last Week
 
 Prices corrected themselves somewhat Friday and Monday as traders started buying in a market strongly oversold earlier last week. But the interest rate increase yesterday halted the recovery.
 
 On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold closed 70 cents to $7.70 lower, with the December contract closing at $566.60 a troy ounce; silver was 40 cents to 56 cents lower, December $14.79 a troy ounce; copper was nine-tenths of a cent to 1.70 cents lower, December 79.55 cents a pound; platinum was $12 to $15 lower, December $550 a troy ounce.
 
 Grain and soybean futures prices closed mixed but mostly lower on the Chicago Board of Trade after opening lower on the news of the prime rate increase.
 
 Weak soybean oil and meal prices also contributed to the selling pressure in soybeans as prices fluctuated in a narrow range numerous times before the close, traders said.
 
 At the close, soybeans were 1 cent lower to 6 cents higher, with the January-delivery contract at $7.66; wheat was 10 cents lower to 2 cents higher, December $4.70 a bushel; corn was 3 3/4 cents lower to 2 1/2 cents higher, December $3.60 a bushel; oats were 3 1/4 cents to 7 1/2 cents lower under an expanded daily trading limit. The December-delivery contract was $2.09 1/2 a bushel. Sugar and Coffee Move Up
 
 Sugar gained the one-cent daily allowable limit on strong trade buying, and coffee found support after the United States Senate approved legislation providing for American participation in the International Coffee Agreement, said Mike Flaherty, an analyst with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith.
 
 At the close on the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York, coffee was 2.31 cents to 3.05 cents higher, December 117 cents; sugar was 0.02 cent lower to 1 cent higher, January 28.95 cents a pound.
 
 Livestock also moved independently, with cattle prices up. Pork bellies were lower, still responding to large slaughters and trying to move down to the level of weakened cash prices, analysts said.  Livestock were also said to be correcting an oversold condition they fell into last week when they were dragged into the liquidation trend with the rest of the commodities.
 
 At the close on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, live cattle were 0.13 cent to 0.35 cent higher, December 65.45 cents a pound; feeders were two-tenths of a cent to 0.48 cent higher, January 75 cents a pound; hogs were a quarter of a cent to 1.50 cents higher, December 48.20 cents a pound; pork bellies were 0.82 cent lower to 0.53 cent higher, February 61.55 cents a pound.
