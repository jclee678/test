Declining American interest rates and continued high inflation helped undermine confidence in the dollar, which fell against key currencies on foreign-exchange markets yesterday.
 
 Gold prices rose above $600 a troy ounce for the first time in two weeks.  Dealers said declining interest rates were the major focus in both markets. Frankfurt dealers said the United States interest rate reductions brought down Eurodollar deposit rates in the course of the day and that the dollar followed suit in a market described as ''almost dead'' in the pre-Christmas vacation period. Eurodollars are dollars held abroad.
 
 Tied to Investment Yields
 
 Lower interest rates tend to make the dollar relatively less attractive since it means lower yields from dollar-denominated investments. But bullion dealers said the lower rates helped push gold prices up in value as the dollar became less attractive.  Continued inflation, as reflected in the November rise in the Consumer Price Index, provided little incentive to buy dollars.
 
 The price of gold in London and Zurich rose above the $600 level for the first time since Dec. 9. In London, gold closed at $605 a troy ounce, compared with Monday's $598.50. In Zurich - Europe's leading bullion market - gold closed at $602.50, a rise of $9.
 
 In later New York trading, the price of gold gained $13.40, to $605.60, in contracts for current delivery traded on the Commodity Exchange Inc. At the Republic National Bank, gold was bid at $604, up $10.25 from Monday's late bid. New York Dollar Rates
