Precious metal and financial futures advanced sharply yesterday on the feeling that interest rates may be near their peak.  Analysts said markets were influenced by widespread but false rumors that recent money supply figures would be revised downward notably because the supply had been reported too high due to a miscalculation by the Federal Reserve.
 
 ''It's just been causing a tremendous amount of consternation here today,'' said a floor manager for a major brokerage house.  Although the report, released after the close of trading, showed no sizable downward revision, its figures were viewed as favorable toward easing interest rates.
 
 The previous week's figures were revised downward by $200 million, compared with the rumored $5 billion to $10 billion. But it was still taken as good news when the Fed said that in the week ended Dec. 10, the basic money supply measure known as M-1A, which includes cash in circulation and commercial bank checking accounts, fell $1.9 billion, to a seasonally adjusted $386.6 billion.
 
 Despite a move by major banks yesterday to increase their prime rate from 20 percent to 21 1/2 percent, the rate they charge their most creditworthy corporate customers, gold gained as much as $25 an ounce while United States Treasury bonds and Government National Mortgage Association certificates gained their two-point daily allowable limit.
 
 Markets have slumped while interest rates spiraled in recent weeks because investors have been selling off their commodity contracts rather than pay higher costs for financing them.
 
 At the close, gold was $25 to $24.80 higher, December $594.30 a troy ounce; silver was 84 cents to 87 cents higher, December $16.15 a troy ounce; copper was 1.50 cents to 1.85 cents higher, December 83.95 cents a pound; platinum was $20 to $30 higher, December $584.30 a troy ounce.
 
 Bonds and Ginnie Maes were up their two-point, or 64-tick, daily limit across the board. A tick represents $31.25 on a contract with a $100,000 principal.
 
 Pork bellies advanced sharply after moving up Thursday in anticipation a Government report next week that is expected to show a decline in the number of hogs and pigs on United States farms.
 
 On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, bellies closed at 1.25 cents to 1.98 cents, February 63.60 cents a pound; hogs were 1.35 cents lower to 1.26 cents higher, December 45.97 cents a pound; live cattle were 0.70 cent lower to 0.55 cent higher, December 65.65 cents a pound; feeders were 0.05 cent to 0.97 cent higher, January 74.25 cents a pound.
