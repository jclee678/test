CONNECTICUT HOUSING;IN HOUSING, IT WAS A YEAR OF CHANGE

COLOR advertisement appearing in national magazines this fall depicts a row of Victorian houses at twilight in the center of an unnamed city. The homes are neither condemned nor burned out nor do they hint of a life of desperation or squalor.
 
 Instead, lights are blazing in what is evidently a very carefully restored home. The interior suggests sophistication and a totally adult environment. The pitch is for a liqueur.
 
 Madison Avenue has provided us with perhaps one of the most graphic statements of the year of how a fusion of factors - sky-high interest rates, galloping energy costs and a radical shift in what is considered a ''normal'' household - is altering the public perception of what constitutes a choice home in a prime neighborhood.
 
 This has unquestionably been a year of change and innovation in housing in Connecticut as elsewhere in the country. Because of the economy, a great many people had to look for new ways to fulfill their shelter needs. Some traded down into smaller quarters, others rented out excess space or remodeled in order to hang on to their low-interest mortgage.
 
 First-time buyers, the most severely affected by inflation, found that they had to settle for what they could afford rather than what they liked, said Patricia Sweet, director of the Connecticut Housing Investment Fund, a nonprofit counseling and financing service for moderate-income buyers.
 
 Many new homeowners could afford to buy only older, dilapidated inner-city houses that needed substantial work. But as more and more people swooped down on this formerly depressed sector of the housing market, urban values responded by escalating faster than many suburban ones, exacerbating the already serious problem of affordable housing.
 
 In Hartford, a three-bedroom, 50-year-old house that sold for $48,000 last fall, was $60,000 by the end of the year, according to Helen Gardner, a Hartford broker. Similarly, in the Westville and East Rock sections of New Haven an older colonial type that would have brought $80,000 a year ago was selling this winter for $100,000, according to Carroll Peck, a New Haven broker.
 
 By contrast, values in residential towns such as Westport and Wilton barely increased because high interest rates and already high prices deterred more and more buyers. For instance, in September the average price of a Westport home was $176,034, only 2.9 percent higher than a year earlier.
 
 Because of the relentless pressure of high interest rates, 1980 was a year when almost no one moved unless there was no other option. And no wonder. Average loan charges on a new mortgage were running 37.4 percent higher than in 1979, according to estimates made by the National Association of Realtors. Median mortgage costs, they noted, rose in one year from $425 to $584.
 
 Many people therefore decided it was better to stay put. One reason was that there was almost no chance of getting a loan under 14 percent except for a brief period during the summer, according to Edward Freda, executive vice president of the Peoples Savings Bank of Bridgeport. This compares, he said, with about 11 percent in 1979.
 
 As a consequence, sales plummeted. Figures compiled by The Commercial Record, a regional trade paper, showed that volume for the first 10 months of the year was 25.7 percent below the similar period of 1979. Only 42,762 sales took place, as against 57,610 the year before.
 
 Developers and builders similarly floundered. High-cost money stymied both their ability to borrow construction funds and the buyer's ability to afford the end product. Only 7,255 building permits were issued for the first nine months of 1980, cas against 11,151 in 1979, according to the Department of Housing - a 34.9 percent decline. Preliminary estimates for yearend figures were that only 9,500 housing units would be built, the lowest figure, said a spokesman in the department, since the state started keeping these records in 1959.
 
 Many of the permits were for condominiums, cluster or attached homes, rather than for the traditional single-family house on its own lot, according to the Home Builders Association of Connecticut.  Affordability was as much a consideration, said Richard Davis, the association's executive vice president, as the rapid decline in the size of the average household, which was verified by the preliminary Census figures released in November.
 
 The high interest rates that prevailed most of the year also forced more and more people to re-examine the option of remodeling or adding on instead of moving. Frequently both weatherization and remodeling were achieved in a combined operation making it possible for the homeowner to hold on to that valuable low-cost mortgage and keep maintenance costs down.
 
 As an example, Gracie and Richard Jahn found that with some careful planning they could enlarge their dark, oil-guzzling Victorian home in Darien and, at the same time, save on energy consumption.
 
 By opening a 600-square-foot wing facing south they were able to gain a passive solar advantage. While workmen were on the site, a new furnace was installed and the heating system modified to conform with zoning regulations. They added extra insulation in the attic and had metal interlocking weatherstripping installed on exterior doors.  The result was not only increased comfort but also an energy tax credit for some of the work.
 
 Investment in energy-saving improvements were important, because by December most homeowners were paying $1.04 a gallon for heating oil -18 cents, or 20 percent, higher than a year earlier, said Russell Kaplan, principal planning analyst of the Division of Energy at the Office of Policy and Management in Hartford.
 
 This was also a year when growing awareness of the need to find relatively moderate-cost housing for the burgeoning elderly population in the state resulted in action. Here again, innovation was much in evidence. In rapid succession towns like New Britain, Enfield, Waterbury, Hartford, West Hartford and Vernon considered or passed zoning changes to allow schools or old mills to be transformed into apartments for the elderly.
 
 In more exclusive communities, hardened resistance to building subsidized housing for the elderly began to soften as pressure from a graying population in these towns mounted sharply. Projects moved from the drawing boards to building sites in Westport, Wilton and Darien. ''People like where they are living and want to be able to stay,'' said William H. Patrick, the First Selectman of Darien.
 
 The year was also marked by the initiation of a number of different programs designed to stabilize a situation in which the poor were increasingly being pushed out of their inner-city neighborhoods by middle-income buyers.
 
 In Hartford, for example, a quasi-government program called A.I.P.  (Apartment Improvement Program) was set up as a catalyst to try to place rental buildings on a more solid footing. Community leaders, city officials, property owners, area bankers and tenants formed a committee with the intention of working together on their common problems. They chose pilot buildings, then selected landlords, who might not normally be eligible for credit at the banks, and arranged special financing so that they could buy and improve the buildings.
 
 Hartford was also the city where a neighborhood housing group, in conjuntion with the Hartford Architecture Conservancy, set up free courses to help low-income owners make their own repairs and therefore better maintain and hold onto their properties.
 
 Similar courses were initiated in Bridgeport in November. These addressed the problem of how to manage a small multifamily house. The aim again was to try to keep the smaller, less sophisticated landlord from abandoning these last outposts of inexpensive rentals.
 
 The year was also described by brokers as a time when more and more nontraditional living arrangements found their way into traditional residential areas.
 
 For example, Martha Michaels and Andrea Covell, flight attendants with American Airlines, tired of seeing their money dissipate in rent receipts and wanting to own a home of their own in a choice area, decided to pool their individual resources and purchase a $110,000 Victorian home in Greenwich. ''We couldn't afford to buy anything alone,'' said Miss Covell. ''And we both recognized the tax advantage of owning.''
 
 Similarly, the illegal-apartment syndrome continued to spread as empty-nesters eager to keep their houses with low-cost mortgages often converted part of their homes into apartments and rented them to singles or couples, thus providing a mutually satisfactory way of coping with increased maintenance costs and the shortage of affordable housing.
 
 There were early signs that some towns, such as Newington and Roxbury, were beginning to recognize the need to legitimize these arrangements. Roxbury ordered a special study, while Newington acted to permit some of them but only under stringent regulation.
 
 In the final analysis, 1980 was a year when we had to face the fact that much of the existing housing - large, costly single-family homes spread out on individual lots - was no longer applicable to our new diversified needs or readily affordable in these inflationary times.  bBethel 31 Linda Lane 3-bedroom, 1 1/2-bath ranch $77,000 1 acre, taxes $1,380, asking $79,900 est. yearly heating needs: 1,143 gals. oil Bethel 30 Windaway Rd.  3-bedroom, 1 1/2-bath ranch $122,000 1 acre, taxes $1,662, asking $125,000 oil costs last year: $900, 2 fireplaces Bethel 31 Fleetwood Ave.  4-bedroom, 1-bath ranch $62,500 town lot, taxes $897, asking $65,900 oil costs last year:$600 New Canaan 84 Stonehenge 4-bedroom, 3 1/2-bath colonial $293,000 2.1 acres, taxes $3,212, pool, asking $295,500 oil used last year: 1,719 gals.
