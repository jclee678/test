In collaboration with American industry, Commerce Department economists have developed a new economic indicator. The new measure, which has not yet been officially released, has been dubbed the Composite Diffusion Index and gives recognition to purchasing-oriented business statistics.
 
 The index is an amalgam of five separate monthly poll results collected and published by the National Association of Purchasing Managers: new orders, production, employment, inventories and vendor performance. The information comes from a survey of 225 purchasing managers in a wide cross section of industries.
 
 According to Theodore S. Torda, senior economist at the Commerce Department, the index has three advantages over the composite monthly leading indicator index: timeliness, accuracy and a good initial sampling.
 
 ''The index has the properties of a leading indicator,'' Mr. Torda said. ''And, since the survey is available at least a month before our own index of leading indicators, is not subject to revision, and is a good sampling of opinion on industrial performance throughout the country, we think it's important.''
 
 The diffusion index takes the number of increases, decreases and no changes for the various components and measures them in percentages.  An index level of 50 percent reflects normal business conditions.
 
 The Commerce Department started experimenting with the index in July. Earlier this year, after several months below 50 percent, the index began to turn up and reached the 50 percent level in September.
 
 In November, it hit 55.7 percent, suggesting an economic upturn.  Mr. Torda expects the December figure, which will be reported early next month, to decline.
