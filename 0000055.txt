CURRENCY MARKETS;Gold Scores Big Gains As Dollar Loses Ground

The dollar dropped sharply and gold prices rose in late trading yesterday as short-term interest rates in money markets reversed their recent upward climb.
 
 Although the prime lending rate charged by most United States banks on business loans rose a half percentage point, to a record 21 1/2 percent, dealers said market activity focused more on short-term rates, which declined.
 
 Rates on three-month Treasury bills, for example, fell below 15 percent, from 16.2 percent late the previous day.  A rumor that huge downward revisions would be reported in weekly money supply figures also drove down interest rates in money markets and prompted dollar selling, dealers said.
 
 Decline in Money Supply
 
 But when the report came out late yesterday afternoon, the narrow measure, M-1A, was revised downward by only a slight $200 million for the previous week. In the latest week ended Dec. 10, the broader measure, M-1B, dropped a substantial $1.9 billion, to $386.6 billion.
 
 High interest rates have sent the dollar up against other key currencies recently because yields on dollar-denominated investments were attractive.
 
 Gold, which also has dropped as interest rates have risen, staged a comeback in New York trading. The price of the metal jumped $24.80, to $594.30 a troy ounce, in current delivery contracts traded on the Commodity Exchange. In later trading at Republic National Bank, gold was bid at $594.50, up $23.50 from Thursday. Gold Moves Higher in Europe
 
 In European trading, gold rose $8.25 an ounce in London, to $584, and $1 in Zurich, to $575.50.
 
 Rates for the dollar, as of 4 P.M. in New York, included: 1.9650 West German marks, down from 1.9880; 4.5663 French francs, down from 4.6060; 1.7800 Swiss francs, down from 1.8050; 207.70 yen, down from 209.77; $1.1918 Canadian, down from $1.1984. The British pound rose to $2.3508, more expensive than Thursday's rate of $2.3255.
 
 The dollar lost ground against all key currencies in European trading except the Dutch guilder, but its fall was not so dramatic.  Dealers said trading was quiet.
 
 In London, the British pound strengthened to $2.3380 Friday from $2.32695 Thursday.  Other dollar rates in major exchange centers abroad included: Frankfurt, 1.9860 marks, down from 1.9920; Zurich, 1.8055 francs, down from 1.8120; Paris, 4.5975 francs, down from 4.6125; Amsterdam, 2.1590 guilders, up from 2.1570, and Milan, 945.35 lire, down from 954.
 
 In Tokyo, where the market closes before trading opens in Europe, the dollar rose from 209 yen Thursday, to 209.30.
