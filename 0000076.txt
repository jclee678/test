AUTO SALES DOWN 7.1%

Sales of cars made in the United States fell 7.1 percent in early December from the level of a year earlier, the auto makers reported today.
 
 The Chrysler Corporation (which, along with the Ford Motor Company, is again offering rebates) was the only one of the Big Three to improve.
 
 The companies delivered a total of 174,498 cars in the latest period, against 166,890 a year before. The percentage comparison is based on sales per day -19,389 against 20,861 - because there was one more selling day in the period this year.
 
 The seasonally adjusted annual selling rate for the five major auto manufacturers recovered to 6.6 million cars in the Dec. 1-10 period from 5.6 million during Nov. 21-30.
 
 Rising interest rates have tended to discourage car buying, as shown by the plunge in late November from an annual rate of 6.8 million in the first two-thirds of the month.
 
 Chrysler, offering rebates that increase as interest rates go up, sold 18,535 cars, compared with 16,054, a rise of 2.6 percent, based on the daily selling rate.
 
 Sales of Chrysler's new ''K'' cars totaled 6,998, their best showing since more than 10,000 were sold during the October introductory period. But it was still only about two-thirds of what the company needed to be on track for its model-year forecast of 490,000 ''K'' cars. Earlier, sales of these compacts were about half the projected pace.
 
 Chrysler, which closed its two ''K''-car plants last week, one week earlier than planned, has also decided to delay reopening after the holidays by another week, until Jan. 12.
 
 ''Their showing is good but not good enough,'' commented Arvid Jouppi, automotive analyst for the brokerage firm of John Muir & Company. ''They clearly need additional financing, but when interest rates come down they can move into profitability. They've cut their costs to almost nothing.'' Rebate Ads Delayed
 
 Ford, which is offering to finance purchases of some of its cars at a maximum interest rate of 12 percent, showed a 13 percent decline during the latest 10-day period, to 39,688 cars from 40,383. A company executive said Ford would have done better, but advertisements of the rebate appeared four days late.
 
 Sales of the General Motors Corporation, which offers no rebates, fell 6.2 percent, to 102,946 from 108,585. Volkswagen of America's Rabbit models, built in Pennsylvania, rose 21 percent, to 3,690 from 2,707.
 
 The American Motors Corporation sold an estimated 4,000 cars, down 26 percent from 4,800. This company's sales must be estimated because it, like the importers, reports sales only at the end of each month.
 
 With 1980 almost over, the five manufacturers were down 20 percent -6,281,308 cars sold, against 7,839,613 last year.  G.M. declined 15 percent, 3,953,063 cars against 4,653,765; Ford 31 percent, 1,399,305 against 2,008,535; Chrysler 29 percent, 615,425 against 868,045, and American Motors 6 percent, an estimated 143,844 against 152,576. Volkswagen was up 8 percent, to 169,671 from 156,692.
